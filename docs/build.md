# Building Holosmith

The only artifacts are static musl binaries for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and
`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` (ADR-0005).

```bash
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh     # rustc + both musl cross toolchains + qemu on PATH
scripts/build.sh              # both targets, then scripts/check-static.sh
```

`scripts/build.sh` copies each artifact to `dist/<target-triple>/holosmith` (by rename,
so an interrupted build never leaves a truncated file there), prints its SHA-256 and
size, and finishes by asserting that both are plain static binaries that run with no
loader and no userspace dependencies. `--target <triple>` builds one, `--no-check` skips
the assertions. `scripts/check-static.sh` can be re-run on its own; it also refuses an
artifact whose `git_tag` is not the tag of this tree, so a stale `dist/` cannot pass.

## Gates

The gate set for this repository is:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

`Cargo.toml` sets `unwrap_used` to `warn`, and a warning cannot fail a build, so
`-D warnings` is what turns it into a gate. `scripts/build.sh` and
`scripts/check-static.sh` are the artifact gate, and `scripts/check-static.sh` is the
assertion `scripts/verify.sh` calls in HS-006 rather than a second way to check the same
thing; until that script exists this is the documented one-command check.

The empty-root run proves there is no dynamic loader and no userspace dependency. It is
not a container run: HS-001's "both run in an empty container" clause stays open until
HS-046's verification run on real Docker hosts (ADR-0005).

## Prerequisites

- **rustc 1.99.1** (the version in `~/.pi/toolchains`). There is no `rust-toolchain.toml`:
  the build fetches nothing beyond its declared dependencies (HS-001).
- **`x86_64-linux-musl-gcc` and `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`** on `PATH`. SQLite is compiled
  from source (`rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature), so the C toolchain crosses too.
- **git** for `scripts/build.sh`. Not required by `cargo build` itself.
- Optional: **`qemu-aarch64-static`** (or point `HOLOSMITH_QEMU_AARCH64` at one) to run
  the aarch64 artifact on an x86_64 machine. It is a machine-local dev tool installed
  outside this repo; no script here downloads it. Without it the check prints one
  `SKIP` line and still passes.
- Optional: **`bwrap`** (bubblewrap) for the empty-root run. Also machine-local; without
  it the check prints one `SKIP` line and still passes.

## Where the target settings live

`.cargo/config.toml` names the two linkers and sets
`rustflags = ["-C", "relocation-model=static"]` per target, which is what makes the
artifacts `ET_EXEC` static binaries instead of static PIE. **Never export `RUSTFLAGS`**:
cargo silently ignores `target.*.rustflags` when that variable is set, so the build would
ship a static-PIE binary with no error. `scripts/check-static.sh` asserts `statically
linked` and an empty `readelf -d` so the mistake fails loudly instead.

## Git tag

`build.rs` reports the tag in this order: `HOLOSMITH_GIT_TAG` if set, otherwise
`git describe --tags --always --dirty`, otherwise `unknown`. `scripts/build.sh` always
sets it, so an artifact never reports the tag of a stale checkout. Builder containers
have no `.git` in the build context, so image builds pass `HOLOSMITH_GIT_TAG` as a build
argument (phase 2); that is why the fallback makes the build succeed instead of failing.
A bare `cargo build` does not set it, and because `build.rs`'s `rerun-if-changed` lines
opt out of cargo's default rerun, a new tag on an unchanged tree leaves the old value in
place: only `scripts/build.sh` guarantees a fresh tag.

## The pinned pi version

It lives in `pins/pi.txt` and nowhere else; the build embeds it, `holosmith version`
prints it and `doctor` will compare the agent image against it. **Do not repeat the
number in this file or anywhere else** — a test (`tests/pin_single_source.rs`) fails if it
appears in a second tracked file.

## Workspace layout

The Cargo workspace root has one member, `crates/holosmith` (ADR-0004), so commands from
the repo root need the package flag: `cargo run -p holosmith -- version`. Build output
goes to `target/`; shipped artifacts to `dist/`; both are git-ignored.

## Reproducibility

Building on this machine is enough for development. Promotion builds run in a pinned
builder container (spec item 10), so `build.rs` and proc macros never run host-side; the
host has to run only the resulting static binary. Until that container exists (phase 2),
`scripts/build.sh` is the documented path and `scripts/check-static.sh` is the evidence
that the artifact is what it claims.

The fetch-nothing claim has a runnable proof, run once per target:

```bash
cargo fetch --locked
bwrap --dev-bind / / --unshare-net --die-with-parent \
  cargo build --release --locked --offline --target <triple>
```

`scripts/check-static.sh` rejects a `source = "git+…"` entry in `Cargo.lock` for the same
reason, so the dependency set cannot start needing the network without a gate failing.
