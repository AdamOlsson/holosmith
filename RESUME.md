# RESUME — one issue per session (next: PER-77 / HS-045, `doctor --quick` and `doctor --full`)

You are the **orchestrator for implementing Holosmith**. `PROMPT.md` is the standing operating procedure and
still governs the cycle; this file is the state of the world, and it adds one rule of its own:

**This session picks up exactly one issue — the one named in §1.** Take it through the whole cycle (§5):
plan, Linear, implement, gates, demo, review, fix, ship, **write the state back** into this file for the next
agent (§5, step 10), then **kill every child you started** and stop (§5, step 11). Do not start a second issue
however much budget is left: a fresh session with a fresh file is how this run continues, and one honest stop
beats two half-finished stories.

The operator is not present. **Never ask a question.** Decide canonically — `HolosmithSpec.md` →
`GLOSSARY.md` → `docs/adr/` → `docs/stories/` → the existing code — record the decision in the Linear issue
and the commit message, and continue.

Read in this order, and no further: **this file**; the issue's slice in `docs/stories/`; the spec items §1
names (and their V-row); the ADR index (one line per decision, `docs/stories/README.md`), then only the ADRs
§1 names; then `docs/notes.md` — the **cross-cutting** section first, then the sections §6 of *this* file
names for this issue. `docs/notes.md` is the durable prose record (the build's shape, the event contract, the
landmines). Anything about a *finished* story is in Linear, `docs/review/PER-<n>.md` and `git log` — not here.

## 0. What this project is

`HolosmithSpec.md` is authoritative. A single-operator system that runs coding agents in containers on
machines you own, driven from a phone. The work is **80 stories** (`HS-001` … `HS-080`) in `docs/stories/`,
one Linear issue each, in five phases:

| Phase | Stories | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — walking skeleton | HS-001 … HS-006 | `docs/stories/phase-0-walking-skeleton.md` |
| 1 — session lifecycle (stub backend) | HS-007 … HS-023 | `docs/stories/phase-1-session-lifecycle-stub.md` |
| 1b — Docker backend | HS-024 … HS-046 | `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md` |
| 2 — deployable MVP | HS-047 … HS-067 | `docs/stories/phase-2-deployable-mvp.md` |
| 3 — multiple machines | HS-068 … HS-074 | `docs/stories/phase-3-multiple-machines.md` |
| 4 — self-development | HS-075 … HS-080 | `docs/stories/phase-4-self-development.md` |

`AGENTS.md` carries the repository rules, including that **Linear scope is exactly one project**: `Holosmith`
(`P-PER-2`, team `Personal`/`PER`). `VulkanRenderAPI` belongs to another repository — never read, create,
comment on, or close anything there.

**Branch `master`** (this repo has **no `main`**; do not rename it). Every commit is pushed; pushing is a
sandbox-specific incantation (§2).

---

## 1. The issue this session picks up: `PER-77` — HS-045, `doctor --quick` and `doctor --full`

**State when this file was written** (the story's last commit, `63892f9`, is `origin/master`; the handoff
commit that carries this file is one further; tree clean apart from the operator's own
`log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`): **49 of 80 stories Done, 31 Backlog**, all in project `Holosmith`. `PER-77` is
`Backlog`, it is the next in `HS-###` order, and its only blocker (`HS-044`, `PER-76`) is `Done` — so it is
eligible. Nothing in the queue is blocked on the machine: the daemon, the agent image and this build's proxies
all work here (§2).

The last shipped story was `PER-76` (HS-044, the startup reconcile and V9; ADR-0053). The last gate run was
green: **66 cases, 722 assertions**; `cargo test` is **798 tests across 46 binaries**, and `web/`'s runner is
**52**.

### 1.1 The slice (verbatim from `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md`; Linear's body is the same text)

`docs/stories/**` is **not edited** (§7).

### 1.2 The spec it proves

`HolosmithSpec.md` item 10 §1's preflight list ("Linux with systemd, Docker reachable, git 2.38 or newer,
Tailscale logged in, free disk above `min_free_gb`, ports free") — the *same* list `server deploy` runs as step
1 and the unit file runs as `ExecStartPre`; item 10 §7 ("Wait for `/api/health`, run `doctor --full` … then
print the URL"); the CLI table's `holosmith doctor [--quick or --full]` row; and V2 ("`doctor` finds git 2.38
or newer, and `git merge-tree --write-tree` exits 0 for a clean merge and 1 with paths for a conflict"). V2's
**Result** cell is empty and this story fills it — HS-046 closes the run.

### 1.3 What already exists

- **`src/preflight.rs`** is the three checks `serve` already refuses on (HS-024, ADR-0028): Docker answers
  `GET /_ping` on `docker_host` (`unix://` and `tcp://`; an `ssh://` endpoint is a *complaint*, because a check
  that cannot run must not report success), `git --version` ≥ `MIN_GIT` (2.38), and `df -Pk` on the data root's
  filesystem against `min_free_gb`. `Tools { git, df }` is the test's shim seam, `Complaint { check, sentence }`
  is one actionable line, `Check::{Docker, Git, Disk, Network}` the word before it. **It answers failures
  only**, and `serve` calls it only when `backend == Docker` and `role != Hub`.
- **`src/selftest.rs`** is the network self-test (HS-036/038/039, ADR-0044/0046/0048): `run`/`run_with`,
  `Outcome::{Passed, Failed, Unknown}`, `complaint()`, `Report`, `leaked`, `pair`, `key_pair`, `NETWORK`,
  `PUBLIC`, `PROXY_TARGET` (`egress-proxy:3128`), `KEY_PROXY_TARGET` (`key-proxy:8080`), `HOST_PORT`, `REACHED`
  (9), `PROBE_TIMEOUT`, and `PROBE` (`include_str!` of `templates/selftest-probe.js`, so the image needs **node**).
  It needs the daemon **and** `agent_image`, makes its own temporary network, and always removes it. `serve`
  calls it once per Docker boot; `Unknown` is a `warn`, `Failed` refuses.
- **`schema::verdict` / `Verdict::sentence`** (HS-075, ADR-0047): "`serve` continues on a newer database and
  `doctor` refuses" is written down and has **no caller** — `serve` warns with the sentence.
- **`db.rs` has one opener and it migrates** (`Database::open` → `apply_pending`). There is no read-only open;
  `scripts/schema-snapshot.sh` gets one from python3's `mode=ro`, which the crate cannot use.
- **`src/cli.rs`** is clap: `version`, `config {validate,show,edit}`, `serve [--port|--data-dir|--backend]`,
  `proxy {egress, key}`, `key {set,list,remove}`, `container snapshot`. **`doctor` does not exist.** Config is 31
  keys, including `role`, `docker_host`, `agent_image`, `min_free_gb`, `data_root`, `control_listen`,
  `preview_listen`; `config show` is where a key is checked before adding one.
- **`agent::version_of` / `version_check` / `version_sentence`** (HS-031): the image's pi version against
  `pins/pi.txt`, asserted once per process at a container launch. `doctor --full`'s "agent image pi version
  equals the pinned pi version" is that same question, asked on demand.
- **`Docker`'s bounded family** (HS-037/041/044): `inspect`, `running`, `container_names`, `network_names`,
  `remove_container_bounded`, `run_detached`, `attempt` — enough for "are the two proxies up" without a new
  primitive.
- **Environment facts on this machine** (measured at this handoff): `git --version` = **2.43.0**, so
  `merge-tree --write-tree` exists and V2's fallback is not needed *here*; Docker 29.9.2 answers; the image is
  `pi-agent:local`; the `egress` network is there. **There is no systemd** (`/proc/1/comm` is `bwrap`, and
  `/run/systemd/system` does not exist), and the `tailscale` CLI **exists** but no daemon answers
  (`failed to connect to local tailscaled`). Both are facts this story has to render honestly, not fail on by
  accident — see §1.5.

### 1.4 What does not exist

No `doctor` command, no `src/doctor.rs`, no report type (a pass *and* a fail, with the check's own words), no
systemd check, no Tailscale check, no port check, no "are `hs_egress`/`hs_key` running" check, no on-demand
image pi-version check, no read-only way to reach `schema::verdict`, and no `case_` that runs a diagnostic
command at all.

### 1.5 The decisions that shape the design

1. **Where the command lives, and what it reuses.** A new `src/doctor.rs` (the check list and its sentences) plus
   `commands/doctor.rs` (clap + printing), following `preflight`/`selftest`'s split. The spec's own words make
   `doctor --quick` *the same list* `server deploy` step 1 runs and `serve` refuses on (ADR-0028: "the sentence
   the operator reads must be the same one either way"), so `preflight::check` must be **reused**, not
   re-implemented — which means the preflight has to grow from "failures only" (`Complaint`) to something that
   also reports a pass, or `doctor` wraps `check_with` and adds the checks `preflight` does not do. Pick one and
   write it down; `preflight`'s existing callers (`serve`, `tests/preflight.rs`, `case_docker_preflight`,
   `case_worktree`'s fake socket) are the constraint.
2. **`--quick` and `--full` are one list with a depth flag**, not two commands: item 10's split is exactly
   "quick = no container", "full = includes the self-test and the proxies". `--full` adds the self-test (daemon +
   `agent_image`, ADR-0044), the network-off probe (already inside the self-test's `pair`), the
   `hs_egress`/`hs_key` running question (`Docker::running`) and the image's pi version (`agent::version_of`).
3. **"Linux with systemd where applicable" is the *role*, and this machine has no systemd.** `serve` by hand is
   a supported way to run on a machine without systemd (`docs/build.md` says so), so a check that refuses here
   would make `doctor` unrunnable on the machine the gate runs on. The precedents are ADR-0044's `Unknown` ("we
   could not measure is not we measured a leak") and `preflight`'s `ssh://` complaint. Recommendation: three
   outcomes — `pass`, `fail`, `unknown`/`warn` — printed with the check's own sentence, and the exit code is
   non-zero only for a *failure*; a `server` deploy (HS-049) is where systemd becomes a prerequisite. Tailscale
   is the same shape: present but not logged in is a line, not a crash, and a `hub` needs it while a `server`
   behind a proxy may not. **Do not invent a `--skip` flag**; the role decides.
4. **Ports free is the check most likely to be wrong on a live machine.** `doctor --quick` runs as
   `ExecStartPre` (before `serve`, ports free) while item 10 §7 runs `doctor --full` **after** deploy, when
   `serve` holds the control port and the preview port. So "port in use" is a failure in the quick list and a
   different fact in the full one (the machine is serving — the port answering `/api/health` is the pass). Say
   which in the sentence, and test both.
5. **A newer database is `schema::verdict`'s, and reaching it without migrating is new work.** `Database::open`
   applies pending migrations, so `doctor` needs either a read-only open (`rusqlite`'s
   `OpenFlags::SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`, a `db.rs` addition) or to read `schema_version` without a `Database`.
   ADR-0047 already promises `doctor` refuses; this is the story that keeps the promise, and the gate's
   `case_schema_newer` already builds the database to point at.
6. **V2 is a measurement on a real repository, and the fallback is conditional.** `git merge-tree --write-tree`
   (git ≥ 2.38, `preflight::MIN_GIT`) exits 0 for a clean merge and 1 with paths for a conflict; the fallback
   (a trial merge in a temporary worktree) is implemented **only** if the version lacks it. This machine has
   2.43, so the branch that runs here is the `merge-tree` one — prove the *version* branch with a shim `git`
   that reports an old version (the `preflight::Tools` pattern: a shim, never a `PATH` edit, which is `unsafe`
   in edition 2024 and shared state).
7. **`ExecStartPre` has no file to change yet.** There is no unit file (HS-049 owns `service install`), so the
   contract this story can make is the **command's exit code** and one actionable line per failure. Record that
   the unit will call `doctor --quick`, and leave the file to HS-049 — do not invent a unit file here.
8. **One line per failure, and the exit code is "any failure".** The acceptance says both; a check's own
   sentence is `preflight`'s rule (it names the fix). A `--json` mode is not asked for and has no consumer;
   `version --json` is the precedent *if* a gate needs one.
9. **What the gate case needs.** The machine has the daemon and the image, so a `case_doctor_full` can be real;
   a `case_doctor_quick` must also be meaningful **without** Tailscale/systemd (see §1.5.3) and must assert the
   exit code and the line for a deliberately broken check (a shim, a temp `data_root`, a bad `docker_host`, an
   occupied port — pick one that cannot touch the machine's own state). Two cases at most; `docs/build.md`
   needs both (a review finding from PER-76: a story's case list is part of the doc).

### 1.6 The questions the plan must answer (before code)

1. **Does `preflight` grow a report, or does `doctor` wrap it?** The spec says the sentences are the same, so
   whatever is chosen must keep `serve`'s refusal and `doctor`'s lines byte-identical. Where does a *pass* line
   come from without inventing a second sentence per check?
2. **What is the outcome vocabulary?** `pass`/`fail` plus `unknown` (ADR-0044's word) — and does an `unknown`
   fail `--quick` on a `server` role? (It must not on this machine, or the gate cannot run it.)
3. **Ports: one check or two moments?** `ExecStartPre` versus item 10 step 7 on a live server (see §1.5.4).
4. **The read-only database question** (§1.5.5): a `db.rs` open, or a direct version read, and what a missing or
   unmigrated database reports.
5. **V2's fallback**: implemented now (dead code on this machine, and a test can only reach it through a shim), or
   recorded as "not needed, the version is ≥ 2.38" like ADR-0035's V1 fallback? The acceptance's conditional is
   the spec's, so the decision is what "if the git version lacks it" means at *implementation* time.
6. **What `doctor` may start.** `--full`'s self-test makes a container and a network; it must remove them, and a
   `doctor` must never leave a container behind (the gate's trap and §2's Docker cleanup).
7. **Does `doctor` need the config at all, and which role?** `config` load is a refusal before the command runs
   (`serve`'s order); `doctor --quick` as `ExecStartPre` runs with the machine's config file, and `--config` is
   the flag the others have.

### 1.7 Acceptance, restated as checks

Every bullet needs something that can fail, and at least one of them is a new `case_*` in `scripts/verify.sh`.

- *"`--quick`: Linux with systemd where applicable, Docker reachable, git ≥ 2.38, Tailscale logged in, free
  disk ≥ `min_free_gb`, required ports free"* — one unit test per check over a shim/seam (the `preflight::Tools`
  pattern: a shim `git`/`df`, a fake daemon socket, a bound port), and a `case_doctor_quick` from the artifact
  that asserts one printed line per check, the exit code, and a deliberately broken check's sentence.
- *"`--full` adds: egress self-test, network-off probe, `hs_egress`/`hs_key` up, agent image pi version equals
  the pinned pi version"* — a gate case with the daemon **and** the image (the self-test's own temporary
  network and container must be gone afterwards; the two proxies' state read with `Docker::running`), and the
  pi-version check against `pins/pi.txt` (a wrong image name via `agent_image` is the failing arm, provable
  without building an image: point it at a name that does not exist and read the sentence).
- *V2* — a test over a `TempDir` repository (`support::repository`): a clean branch merge → 0, a conflicting one
  → 1 with the path; and the old-git arm through a shim reporting 2.37 (or the decision that the fallback is not
  implemented, recorded like ADR-0035's V1).
- *"Exit non-zero on any failure, with one actionable line per failure"* — the gate case's exit code and the
  line count; a warning/unknown must not change the code.
- *"`ExecStartPre` uses `--quick`"* — no unit file exists; the contract is the exit code, and HS-049 owns the
  file. Record it (an ADR note, not a claim that a file was written).

Then `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cd web && npm test &&
npx tsc --noEmit`, and `scripts/verify.sh` — all green on a clean tree (§3), plus the story's own demo against
the **shipped artifact** (§1.9).

### 1.8 Non-goals

- **The phase-1 verification run** (HS-046, which fills V1–V10's Result cells and closes the table).
- **`server deploy` and the unit file** (HS-049): `ExecStartPre=holosmith doctor --quick` is its line to write.
- **The image builds** (HS-048): `doctor --full` asks the configured `agent_image`; it does not build one.
- **`status`, `logs`, `uninstall`** (HS-050) and **drain** (HS-051).
- **A new config key**, a `--json` report with no consumer, and a `--skip` flag.

### 1.9 The demo

From the **shipped binary** on this machine's real daemon: `doctor --quick` printing one line per check with
pass/fail/unknown (including the honest lines for a machine with no systemd and no Tailscale daemon) and its
exit code; then `doctor --full`, which runs the network self-test (its own temporary network and container) and
reads the two proxies' state and the image's pi version. Then break one thing deliberately and show the sentence
and the non-zero exit — the cheapest honest break is a config whose `docker_host` points at an absent socket
(the `case_docker_preflight` and `case_worktree` pattern) or a `min_free_gb` no disk can meet. Bound every
process, and remove every container/network/proxy the demo started in its trap (§2's landmine: `serve` starts
`hs_egress`/`hs_key` and they outlive it; `doctor --full` must remove its own).

### 1.10 What the next agent needs back

When you write the state back (§5, step 10): §1 becomes the **next** issue — by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking, that is
`PER-78` (HS-046 — the phase-1 verification run that fills the table and is the gate for phase 2) — with the
same shape: slice, spec, what exists, what does not, the decisions that shape the design, the acceptance as
checks, non-goals, the demo. Refresh the counts, the ADR number you took (**ADR-0054** is next) and the last
gate run's own numbers, and replace §9's row with this story's (short — one paragraph). Anything you learned
that is **not** state and **not** an ADR goes into `docs/notes.md` under a new `### Landmines: …` heading, never
into §1. Then kill what you started (§5, step 11) — a session that leaves a child or a container behind blocks
the next one.

## 2. Environment (already repaired — do not redo)

Everything below lives **outside the repo** and survives. If this is a fresh container, redo it exactly
as written.

```bash
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh      # ALWAYS source this before cargo/rustc
```

It sets `RUSTUP_HOME`, `CARGO_HOME` and `PATH` to:

- rustup 1.99.1, minimal profile + clippy/rustfmt, targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`;
- musl.cc cross toolchains for both arches (`x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`, `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/cc` → `/usr/bin/gcc` (the `cc` crate needs a `cc` on PATH);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/qemu-aarch64-static` (7.2.0) — an **optional dev tool** so the aarch64 artifact
  can actually be *run* here. No repo script may download it; `scripts/check-static.sh` prints one
  `SKIP` line when it is absent and still passes.

Why outside the repo: `/` is a 3.4 GB tmpfs and `~/.pi` is the only large writable ext4 mount.

**Available:** node 24.22.2 / npm 11.19.1 with the npm registry reachable (node 24 strips TypeScript
types natively, which is what `npm test` relies on); `curl`; `python3` (with stdlib `sqlite3` and
`http.client`); `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, `cmp`, `find`, `timeout`, `git`; **Playwright's Chromium**
(`~/.cache/ms-playwright`, bound read-only by `bwrap.sh`) and the `playwright` npm package at
`~/.cache/hs-browser/pw/node_modules`. Two quirks, both hit: ESM **ignores `NODE_PATH`**, so a script
imports the package by its own path — `…/playwright/index.mjs` (the `.js` entry is CJS and its default
export does not have `chromium` at the top level); and Chromium must be launched with
`--no-sandbox`, because its own namespace sandbox cannot nest inside ours. A third, learned in HS-020:
**`networkidle` never settles** on the sessions list, because a live row holds an `EventSource` open —
navigate with `domcontentloaded` and wait for the rows.
**Available since this session: a real Docker daemon.** `docker version` shows a 29.9.2 server, `/var/run/docker.sock` exists,
`docker run` works and images pull over the network. `bwrap.sh` binds the host's socket at
`/var/run/docker.sock` (`DOCKER=()` … `--bind "$sock" /var/run/docker.sock`), so a `docker` inside the
sandbox drives the real daemon — that is host root by another name and it is granted deliberately; a
machine without a socket simply gets no binds. **`pi-agent:local` is loaded and is the image every Docker
story uses**: its pi version equals `pins/pi.txt` exactly (`agent::version_check` asserts it at launch), git
2.39.5, node 24, default user `node` (uid **1000**, the host uid). Everything the Docker chain needs is here,
including network access for `alpine:3` and friends. **A preview demo needs `node` inside the container** —
this image has it, and so must any image `agent_image` points at (HS-036 learned that the hard way: a missing
node is exit 127, not a test failure). **A `serve` boot starts `hs_egress` and `hs_key` and they outlive
it**, so a gate run or a demo leaves both running: remove them (`docker rm -f hs_egress hs_key`) when you
want `tests/container.rs`'s egress-proxy test to run its *real* path, which it skips while a proxy is running.
The machine's own `egress` network must exist for that test (`docker network create egress` is the call a boot
makes) — a cleanup removed it once and the test failed on setup at HS-043's baseline.

**pi's own RPC documentation is on this machine**:
`~/.pi/agent/install/releases/1.5.0/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` (how to start
it, the JSONL framing rules — one complete JSON object per line, split on LF only, never a reader that also
splits on U+2028), `rpc-commands.md` (the `prompt`/`steer`/`abort`/`get_state` commands and the `disposition`
field), `json.md` (the event stream: `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, tool and message events),
`rpc-extension-ui.md` (the UI requests `pump` auto-cancels) and `environment-variables.md`. The binary in
the image is `/usr/local/bin/pi`, its version already equals `pins/pi.txt`, and `pi --mode rpc --no-session`
is the launch `agent::COMMAND` builds. `pi --help` in the sandbox is the same version's, so an experiment
is free; nothing in the repo may hard-code the path to those documents.

**Not available, and not to be invented:** no `sudo`, no `apt`, no `gh`, no ssh key (the agent has one,
§pushing), **no systemd** (`/proc/1/comm` is `bwrap`; `/run/systemd/system` does not exist) and **no Tailscale
daemon** — the `tailscale` CLI *is* at `/usr/bin/tailscale`, but `tailscale status` answers
`failed to connect to local tailscaled`, which is the fact HS-045 has to render rather than fail on. There is a
**browser** (`docs/notes.md`, fact 3), but no *gate* may need one.
**No `awk`** and **no `shellcheck`** on this machine — do not write a script or a gate that needs
either.

### Linear access

There are no Linear tools in the tool list. `list_issues` / `save_issue` / `save_comment` / `get_issue`
are reachable through the same HTTP MCP endpoint `scripts/import-linear.py` uses, so drive it from a
wrapper. Recreate `/tmp/lin.py` if it is gone (`/tmp` is ephemeral):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Thin CLI over the Linear MCP server, reusing scripts/import-linear.py plumbing.
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py issues            # id, title, status

a = sys.argv[1:]
if a[0] == 'issues':
    for i in imp.call('list_issues', {'project': PROJECT, 'limit': 250})['issues']:
        print(i['id'], i['status'], i['title'][:70])

Always run it with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `rm -rf scripts/__pycache__` afterwards, or you will
leave an untracked `scripts/__pycache__/` behind. `list_issues` on this project returns **80 issues**
(not 250); `grep -v ' Done '` is the quickest way to the unfinished ones.

**Two API traps, both hit already:**

- `save_issue` takes `state` (the **name**, e.g. `"In Progress"`). It rejects `stateId`.
- `get_issue` takes only `id`. Passing `project` is a validation error.

The team's states are `In Review`, `Backlog`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`, `Todo`, `In Progress`.
Never invent a state name.

**Token expiry is routine, not a blocker.** When a call prints `The Linear access token has expired.
Re-authenticate 'linear' in pi.`, refresh it in place — the store keeps a refresh token and a client id:

```python
import json, os, time, urllib.request, urllib.parse
p = os.path.expanduser('~/.pi/agent/mcp-auth.json'); key = 'mcp__linear|https://mcp.linear.app/mcp'
d = json.load(open(p)); e = d[key]
body = urllib.parse.urlencode({'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
                               'refresh_token': e['tokens']['refresh_token'],
                               'client_id': e['clientInformation']['client_id']}).encode()
req = urllib.request.Request(e['discovery']['authorizationServerMetadata']['token_endpoint'],
                            data=body, method='POST',
                            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})
new = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=60).read())
e['tokens'] = {**e['tokens'], **new}
e['tokensExpireAt'] = int((time.time() + int(new.get('expires_in', 3600))) * 1000)
json.dump(d, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
```

If that fails, **stop and report** — that is a `PROMPT.md` stop condition.

### Pushing

**Pushing works, through the sandbox's ssh-agent — but the sandbox's own `~/.ssh/config` gets in the
way.** `origin` is `git@github.com:AdamOlsson/holosmith.git`; `bwrap.sh` binds the host's
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at `/run/ssh-agent.sock` (the private key never enters the sandbox), so a push signs on
the host. The bound `~/.ssh/config` has a `Host github.com` block with `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github`, and
that file is **not** in the sandbox, so a plain `git push` fails with
`no such identity: /home/adamolsson/.ssh/github: No such file or directory` / `Permission denied
(publickey)`. It is intermittent — it worked once and failed the next commit — so use the override every
time:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' git push origin master
```

`-F /dev/null` is the load-bearing part: it stops ssh reading the sandbox's `~/.ssh/config` at all, which
is what names the missing key. (A plain `git push` worked once and then stopped; `-c
core.sshCommand='ssh -o IdentityAgent=…'` was not enough either — the config still won.) `ssh -T
git@github.com` with those options answering `Hi AdamOlsson!` is the way to check the agent before
blaming the remote.

**The reliable form offers ONE key.** The agent holds three, and *which* GitHub accepts changes between
sessions — in this session it was the **third**, offered by `sed -n '3p'`, after the first two were rejected
(`ls-remote` succeeded with it once and failed the next time, so retry the loop rather than trusting one
probe). Loop over the three, offer one at a time, and push as soon as one works:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do ssh-add -L | sed -n "${i}p" > /tmp/k.pub
  GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/k.pub \
    -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git" \
    git push origin master && break; done
```

(The older single-key form, for reference:)

```bash
ssh-add -L | sed -n '2p' > /tmp/pushkey.pub
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/pushkey.pub \
  -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' \
  git push origin master
```

(`-i` names a `.pub` that is in the agent: ssh offers exactly that one and signs with the agent's copy.)
`git ls-remote` with the same options is the cheap way to tell "pushed" from "the agent refused again".
Push after every commit that matters, and if a push fails, report it — do not fake one.

## 3. The gates

`. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh` first. Then:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test                          # lib + every test binary; the run prints the counts
cargo test --test schema_previous   # the `migrations` phase, run on its own
cd web && npm test                  # the transcript's rules, node's own runner
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit          # not a gate phase, but a web edit that does not typecheck is a bug
scripts/verify.sh                   # THE one-command gate since HS-006
```

`scripts/verify.sh` runs seven phases, cheapest first: `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, **`migrations`**
(`cargo test --test schema_previous` — the expand/contract rule, HS-075), `build` (`scripts/build.sh`, which
itself runs `build-web.sh` — `npm test` then Vite — and `check-static.sh` last), `embed`
(`scripts/check-embed.sh`), then `serve` — the **shipped musl artifact** booted on `--port 0` with a temp data
dir, running its cases plus a CORS sweep, then torn down with `SIGTERM` and an asserted exit 0. **The run
prints its own case and assertion counts — quote those, never a number copied out of this file.** It takes
~10 min (both musl targets, the Docker cases, `case_idle_stop`'s real minute and `case_preview`'s container). `--no-build` skips `build`
and `embed`; `--keep` keeps the work dir.

Some cases bring their own boot, and they are the ones a new story is most likely to collide with:

| Case | What it needs |
| --- | --- |
| `case_token_budget`, `case_usage_survives_resume`, `case_compaction`, `case_history`, `case_backup`, `case_worktree`, `case_worktree_refusal`, `case_agent_launch`, `case_docker_resume`, `case_docker_turn`, `case_internet_toggle` | its own `serve`, and (the last four) the daemon and `agent_image` |
| `case_docker_preflight` | no server at all |
| `case_container_mounts` | no server *and* no daemon — one printed `SKIP` line when there is neither a daemon nor an image |
| `case_exit_classification` | `python3` (it reads a row's `expected_stop` out of `app.db`), skips without it |
| `case_egress_proxy` | **no** server, daemon, internet or key: it starts the artifact as `proxy egress` on a loopback port and asks it four questions over a socket |
| `case_schema_newer` | no daemon; boots the artifact over a schema-99 database |
| `case_key_proxy_request` | a stand-in `openssl` on `PATH`; asserts the bytes the key proxy really sends |
| `case_preview` | **its own boot** (stub backend, own data root, `preview_listen = "127.0.0.1:0"`) and, for its second half, the daemon and `agent_image` — it makes its own `s_<id>` container on an `--internal` `agents_<id>` and prints one `SKIP` line without them; the first half always runs and puts the shared boot back |

A story is not done until the gates are green on a clean tree, and then you run the story's own demo
yourself and paste its output.

**Every story adds at least one `case_*`** — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md` and the reviewer enforces
it. Two shapes to avoid: a case that *needs* a session created two cases earlier, and a case whose `SKIP`
would also fire when the feature it checks is deleted (§6).

**Run one build at a time.** A `scripts/build.sh` or `scripts/verify.sh` in the same tree while another
one runs can make `check-static.sh`'s banner wait flake under load (it happened once during HS-013: the
gate reported `FAIL build/failed` while the same command passed a minute later, alone). Serialise them.

**Rebuild after committing.** `git describe` is baked into the artifact and `check-static.sh` fails on a
stale `dist/`, so a commit without a rebuild leaves the gate red. Commit, then `scripts/verify.sh`, then
the demo you paste.

**Rebuild after editing `web/`, before any demo.** The artifact embeds `web/dist`, so a demo run against
an artifact built before the page changed is a demo of the *old* page — and it will look like your fix
did nothing. HS-020 lost a demo cycle exactly this way: the fix to `main.ts` was invisible until
`scripts/build.sh` ran again. `scripts/verify.sh` rebuilds, so "gate green, then demo" is the safe order.

                            (git's `worktree remove` for a registered orphan, `remove_dir_all` for an
                            unregistered one, never a branch or a ref), `Reconciler::{new, run}` and

  src/turn.rs               the turn runner (HS-015) and the turn timeout (HS-022): touch → the
                            backend's turn → agent_settled + touch, abort_completed (or a `debug` line if
                            the ladder got there first), or unexpected_exit with the reason. Under a
                            deadline the ladder is *spawned* and the turn keeps being awaited;
                            `TURN_TIMEOUT`, `turn::timeout(minutes)`. `TurnEnd` is the backend's answer
  src/ladder.rs             the abort ladder (HS-016): clear_queue → abort → wait out abort_grace →
                            `running → stopped` with the caller's reason → stop. `climb` adds the
                            resume (the abort); `end_turn` returns `Ending::{Asked,Forced}` and does
                            not (the delete, the timeout and the budget). `FORCED_ABORT`
  src/sweeper.rs            the idle stop's task (HS-021): `Sweeper::sweep` (one pass, public for tests),
                            `run` (the tick loop), `spawn`; `IDLE_STOP`, `TICK` (5 s, a constant)

                            stderr)` which takes the flag, applies `PiExit` or `UnexpectedExit`, and appends

### What exists and what does not

- **Working:** `version` (text + `--json`), `config {validate,show,edit}`, `serve` (control listener,
  embedded app, `/api/health`, `POST`/`GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/{prompt,abort,steer,resume}`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}[?force=true]`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events`, `…/events/history`, `…/tool-output/{tool_id}`,
  `…/tool-image/{tool_id}/{index}`), SQLite with **four** migrations, the guards, the event writer (which
  coalesces a commit's deltas), the SSE stream, the stub backend and its four-step provisioner, the
  enforced state machine, the abort ladder, the delete flow, the cap with eviction, the create's and the
  resume's three project refusals, the compaction task (which folds a day-old message into one
  `message.snapshot`), the Sessions screen with its create form (which prints a project
  refusal's sentence alone) and the "nothing was deleted" notice, the session screen at
  `/sessions/<id>` with a live transcript and a four-action composer.
- **The agent is real (HS-031) and so is a turn (HS-032 – HS-034).** A Docker create provisions the worktree,
  the network, the attached container running pi in RPC mode, and pi's ready handshake, and ends **`idle`**;
  the agent's directory and the launch line are under the data root, the exit the attached stdio observes is
  classified, and a resume replaces the container and reaches `idle` again. A **prompt** reaches pi, its
  records become the transcript's frames, a tool call's output is filed, and the session's spend is counted —
  with one gap a real container still shows: pi refuses a `prompt` before a stream exists, because a session's
  network is `--internal`, its pi-home has only a dummy key, and the gate's machine stores no provider key, so
  `case_docker_turn` asserts pi's own refusal sentence and the streaming evidence is the committed fixtures —
  while HS-040's recorded run is the evidence that a real turn works end to end through the key proxy (text and
  thinking deltas, a tool round trip, usage), because the gate may not hold a provider key.
- **The egress proxy exists and is the only route out (HS-037).** `holosmith proxy egress` is a mode of the
  artifact; a Docker boot starts `hs_egress` on `egress` (bounded, `warn` on failure) and the network step
  joins it to a session's network under the alias `egress-proxy` **only when the row's `network` flag is set**,
  so `HTTPS_PROXY` is the same string either way and the difference is topology. HS-038 measured that (the boot's
  bare/joined pair and `case_internet_toggle`) and left the **copy** under the checkbox to whoever next owns the
  create form, because a new element is a UI change in a phase that forbids one (ADR-0046).
- **The migration rule has two halves and both are enforced (HS-075).** `schema::contract_violations` refuses an
  unmarked destructive statement in a migration (`cargo test`), and `tests/schema_previous.rs` refuses a drop or a
  rename against `docs/schema/previous.sql` — the gate calls the second the `migrations` **phase**. Refreshing
  that snapshot is a **release step** (`scripts/schema-snapshot.sh`), not a story's, and a contract migration
  changes it in the same commit. `schema::verdict` is the sentence `serve` warns with on a newer database and
  `doctor` will refuse with (ADR-0047).
- **The startup reconcile landed (HS-044).** `serve` awaits `Reconciler::run` right after the state exists and
  before the sweeper and the compactor are spawned: every live row goes to `starting` (with `interrupted` when a
  turn was in flight), the names no row owns are swept (a container unless its row is a `deleting` delete in
  progress; a network and a worktree directory only when no row has the id; never a branch or a ref), and the
  sessions are provisioned again. **What is left of the network half:** `doctor` (HS-045) and the phase-1
  verification run (HS-046). The delete's keep-rules (HS-043) are done and ADR-0052: `agent/<id>` survives a
  delete when it is ahead of its base and in no target, `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` survives when its tree
  differs from the branch, the 202 carries `kept` (one additive key on the flattened row) and is the same
  decision the spawned removal applies, and the session screen has the **delete affordance it did not have**
  — a Delete button, a confirm step and the forced retry a `409 unsaved_work` earns. **V9 passes** (HS-044);
  nothing in the spec's table is unrun now except V2 (HS-045/046), V6 (HS-046's run of HS-037's parts), V8 and
  V10 — and `doctor --full` (HS-045) is what makes the first three repeatable. The preview listener (HS-041) is
  done: the binary's third byte tunnel, `/‹host›/‹id›/*` with the prefix stripped and an upgrade's `Origin`
  checked, and **V7 passes** (the host reaches a container on an
  `--internal` network, measured directly and through the artifact). The key proxy (HS-039) and its
  **verification** (HS-040 — V3, V4 and V5 pass) and the WIP snapshot (HS-042) are done, and the spec's
  verification table has a **Result** column that HS-046 finishes filling.
- **The log is now read in two shapes and written by two producers of two kinds.** The stream replays a
  *window* (`history_window`, default 50) and says so with `history.truncated`; `GET …/events/history`
  answers the frames below that cursor. `events/stream.rs`'s `REPLAY_LIMIT` is still `u32::MAX` — it is
  "everything from the cut", and a second window there would be an invisible truncation. The project
  backup is a second *writer* of files under the data root (`<data>/backups/`), not of the database.
- **A stop is now recorded as the server's own, and a clean exit has its own state row — observed.**
  `Stopper` writes `expected_stop` before the `docker stop`, and `Exits::record` turns an exit into `stopped`
  (expected), `stopped · pi_exit` (code 0, no flag) or `error` + the last stderr lines. Since HS-031 its
  caller is the task the provisioner spawns after a successful pi step, fed by the backend's `ExitWatcher`
  (ADR-0039). Do not "fix" anything by adding a `docker events` watcher: the attached process *is* the
  observation.
- **Four policies can now stop something and they must not be confused:** the cap evicts (`evicted`,
  inside a create), the sweeper stops a quiet one (`idle_stop`, on its own tick), the turn timeout ends a
  *turn* (`turn_timeout`, from the runner) and the token budget ends a *turn* (`budget_exceeded`, also from
  the runner, on one `fired` shared with the timeout so only one climb happens). All of them go through
  `Transitioner::apply`, and the row moves before the container in every one of them.
- **`runtime::Backend`** has `Stub` and `Docker`; `serve --backend` and the config key `backend` select
  it. `DockerBackend::new(ContainerSettings)` provisions all four steps, runs a turn's five operations and
  implements the WIP snapshot. The default backend is **`docker`** (ADR-0001: the stub is opt-in), so a
  default build provisions a session to `error` with a reason rather than hanging in `starting`, and
  `scripts/verify.sh` boots with `backend = "stub"` in its config (so does `scripts/check-static.sh`'s
  empty-root run, because a Docker run refuses at startup on a machine that fails the preflight, HS-024, and
  that sandbox has no daemon, no `git` and no `df`). (Since HS-026 a create for a project that is not a plain
  checkout is refused earlier, with a 422; the demo trick HS-019 used still works for a project that *is*
  one — which is also how HS-019 provoked a real failed snapshot from the shipped artifact.)
- **`AppState`** is `{ config, runtime, database: Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Database>>, events: EventWriter,
  streams: StreamRegistry, backend: Backends }`, with **eight** wiring helpers — `provisioner()`,
  `turner()`, `transitioner()`, `ladder()`, `deleter()`, `sweeper()` (an `Option`, `None` when
  `idle_stop_min` is 0), `compactor()` (always `Some`) and `reconciler()` (HS-044). The mutex is an explicit
  stopgap (ADR-0012/0013; `docs/notes.md`'s *Data and state* landmines).
- **`sessions::state::Transitioner::apply`** is the only way a session's state changes; `apply_logged`
  is the runners' wrapper (log, never return). A provisioning step report is `from == to` with `step`
  set and is *not* a table row.
- **The create is one lock scope plus a loop.** `create_locked` answers `Slot::{Inserted, Existing,
  Full}`; a `Full` makes `slot_for` evict one idle session (through `apply`, which takes the lock
  itself) and try again. Idempotency is checked first, so a retry never evicts anyone. `evict_one`
  moves the row **before** it spawns the backend's `stop`, because the row is what frees the slot.
- **`config`** has (`31` keys now) `agent_image` (default `agent-image:<binary version>`; this machine's
  demos and the gate set `pi-agent:local`), `container_cpus` (2), `container_memory_mb` (4096),
  `container_pids` (512) — all three **refuse `0`** — plus `abort_grace` (default `10s`, **used** by the ladder), `idle_stop_min`,
  `stopped_ttl_days`, `min_free_gb`, `turn_timeout_min`, `max_session_tokens` and the rest — check
  `config show` before adding a key. The delete flow and **compaction** have **no** config key of their
  own (the 24-hour window is a constant), and `max_live_sessions` (default 3, ≥ 1) is the cap.
- **`POST /resume`** takes the transition, then spawns the provisioner, and **touches `last_active_at`**
  (a resumed session must not be the eviction's first candidate — which is now a real policy, not a
  future one). The cap is checked **before** the transition, and the resume answers `409 cap_reached`
  rather than evicting (ADR-0022, ADR-0024). `SessionBackend::resume` has had a body since HS-029 and is how
  a `stopped` row comes back.

## 5. The cycle — one issue, then write the state back

Everything is **sequential: one writer at a time**, never two children editing files. Review children are
read-only and may run in parallel.

1. **Confirm the issue.** Read §1's slice, the Linear body (`python3 /tmp/lin.py issue <IDENT>`, §2) and the
   spec items. **Check the issue's title against the story you mean** — the Linear number is not derivable
   from the `HS-` number (HS-059 is `PER-91`, not `PER-93`; a session wrote `Closes PER-93` for it and had to
   record the correction in three places). Note `HEAD` — that SHA is the review's fixed point.
2. **Plan.** For an **L** story, give a fresh `delegate` child a grilling brief
   (`~/.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` + `domain-modeling`): it puts **one** round of questions to *you*
   via `contact_supervisor`, and you answer with `subagent_supervisor({action:"reply", …})`. For **S/M**
   (HS-043 is M), write the plan yourself — it is faster and the analysis is usually already done. Either
   way: state the environment facts, name the files to read, list the decisions already settled, and
   **pre-answer the obvious round-2 questions**. A planner may write only `GLOSSARY.md` and a new
   `docs/adr/*.md`.
3. **Record in Linear before any code exists**: `save_comment` with the plan shape, a decisions→precedent
   table, the acceptance restated as testable checks, the non-goals, the docs touched, the demo, and the
   follow-ups; then `state` the issue `In Progress` and re-read it to confirm.
4. **Implement.** Two proven patterns: **S/M in-session** (most stories since HS-016), or **M/L with a lot
   of new surface** handed to a fresh `worker` child with a *written* brief — the plan plus the "how", the
   ground rules (no commit, no Linear, no new dependency, `env.sh` first, don't edit `docs/stories/**`), the
   exact gate commands, and "budget discipline: keep the tree compiling; if you run long, stop green and
   report which steps remain". Twice a child found a genuine contradiction in the brief — verify its claims
   rather than trusting them.
5. **Verify yourself.** Never trust a child's pasted output: run the gates and the demo. This has caught
   something every time (a wrong count, a demo-revealed message bug, a panic path, an assertion that passed
   over an already-stopped row).
6. **Review** with a fresh `reviewer` child running `~/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, read-only,
   against `<fixed point>...HEAD` plus untracked files, spec axis sourced from the Linear body + story slice
   + spec items. `git add -A` first and write `git diff --cached <fp>` to
   `/tmp/holosmith/reviews/PER-<n>-diff.txt` so new files appear. **The reviewer has no shell and no write
   tool**: check its claims, and *you* save the review verbatim to `docs/review/PER-<n>.md`. **Commit before
   launching it** — a child reading a tree that moves under it stalls.
7. **Fix** in the same session (or with a fresh `worker`), triaging every finding as fixed or
   dismissed-with-citation; a "won't fix" without a citation is not acceptable. Re-run the gates. Append a
   `## Resolution` table to the review file and commit it with the fixes. If a claim cannot be dismissed,
   mutate the code and watch the guarding test go red before believing it.
8. **Ship**: focused conventional commits that name the issue, the last one ending `Closes <IDENT>` (§1's
   identifier). Commit messages are prose about *why*, not a restatement of the diff — look at the last few
   for tone. Rebuild after committing (§3). Then `save_comment` with what shipped, the gates, the verbatim
   demo output, the acceptance item by item and the follow-ups; set the issue `Done`; re-read it to confirm.
9. **Push**, with the sandbox's single-key loop (§2). If the push fails, report it — never fake one.
10. **Write the state back.** Rewrite §1 of this file for the next issue (§1.10's shape), refresh
    the counts, the ADR number, the last gate run's numbers and §9's row, then commit that with the message
    `Refresh the handoff after <IDENT>`. Set §1's replacement by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking (Linear priority →
    `HS-###` order → anything already `In Progress` → skip an issue whose `Blocked by` stories are not `Done`).
11. **Kill every child you started, then stop.** This is the last thing a session does, and it is not
    optional: a child still running holds the working tree, a port, a data root or a Docker network, and the
    next agent then finds a tree that moves under it, a port that is taken, or a `case_*` that fails for a
    reason that belongs to *your* session. Nothing may outlive the session that started it.
    - **Subagent children:** `subagent({action:"list"})` and `subagent({action:"stop", id})` on every run
      that is still live — the planner, every `worker`, every `reviewer`, and one you left `interrupted`. A
      run that already answered needs nothing; a run that is *listed as running* is the one that matters.
      `stop` is not resumable, which is exactly right at the end of a session: a half-finished brief is
      recoverable from Linear and `docs/review/`, a child that keeps editing the tree is not.
    - **Processes:** every demo's `serve`, every backgrounded `timeout` wrapper, `scripts/verify.sh` if you
      interrupted it, and any `node`/`python3` client you left running. **Score the pids when you start them
      and kill those pids** — `pgrep -f 'holosmith serve'` matches unrelated processes (a landmine, in
      `docs/notes.md`), so a pattern-based kill is both too broad and unreliable.
    - **Docker:** `docker rm -f` every container a demo or a test made (`s_*`, `hs_*` names of yours) and
      `docker network rm` the `agents_*` network it made; leave the machine's own `hs_egress`/`hs_key`
      alone if `serve` is not yours to stop, and never remove a container you did not create.
    - **Check it, do not assume it:** `subagent({action:"list"})` shows nothing running, the pids you scored
      are gone, `docker ps` shows none of your containers, and `git status --short` is clean apart from the
      operator's own `log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`. Then say in one line what you killed, and stop.

Working artifacts (`/tmp` is ephemeral; the durable record is Linear + `docs/review/` + `git log`):

## 6. Which notes bear on this issue

The catalogue lives in **`docs/notes.md`** — read the **cross-cutting** sections before you start anything,
then the sections below. It is a reference: everything there is a measurement or a review finding.

| Read | Why it bears on `doctor` |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-cutting: *Build and toolchain*, *Tests*, *HTTP and the envelope*, *Data and state*, *Web*, *Config and docs*, *Reviews*, *Demos* | True of every story. The **Tests** and **Demos** sections are where this one is most likely to go wrong: every check needs a shim rather than the machine (a `PATH` edit is `unsafe` in edition 2024), and `--full` starts a container and a network it must remove. |
| *Landmines: startup checks, refusals and the writer's tick (HS-023, HS-024)* | `preflight` **is** the list this story publishes: its `Tools { git, df }` seam is how a check is tested without the machine, its `ssh://` rule is "a check that cannot run must not report success", and its "a startup check must run before the thing it protects" is why `serve`'s order is the contract. The eight-line banner rule is why a new startup fact is `debug!`. |
| *Landmines: Docker — mounts, containers, starts (HS-027 – HS-029)* | `docker`'s flags, the bounded family, `inspect` as the only place a running container's truth is visible, and the gate's SKIP shape for a machine without a daemon — all four are what `--full`'s proxy and image questions have to live with. |
| *Landmines: the network self-test (HS-036)* | `--full` runs `selftest::run`: `Passed`/`Unknown`/`Failed` and why only `Failed` refuses, the node probe and the image's `node`, `REACHED` and "a refused connection counts as reached", and the temporary network it must always remove. |
| *Landmines: the egress proxy (HS-037)* | `hs_egress`'s name, its `egress` network, and the fact that a `serve` boot leaves both proxies running — so `--full` reports *their* state and a demo must clean them by name. |
| *Landmines: the credential path (HS-040)* | `hs_key`, `keys.toml`'s 0600 mode, and the store being a **directory** (`<data>/secrets`): `doctor` asks whether the proxy is running, never reads a key. |
| *Landmines: the agent launch (HS-031)* | `agent::version_of`/`version_check`/`version_sentence` are the "image's pi equals `pins/pi.txt`" question, and the image's own default user and `node` are what the self-test needs. |
| *Landmines: the checkbox's pair, and expand/contract (HS-038, HS-075)* | ADR-0047's split is exactly this story's: `serve` warns on a newer database and **`doctor` refuses**, with `schema::verdict`/`Verdict::sentence` as the one sentence both use. Reaching it must not migrate the database. |

Three rules worth repeating here because they are the most expensive to relearn: **a test that cannot fail
is worse than no test** (mutate the behaviour and watch it go red); **a gate case that SKIPs on the bug it
exists to catch is this project's P1**; and **after any scripted Markdown edit, read the changed lines** —
three such edits have cost a review finding each.

---

## 7. Decisions taken on the operator's behalf (do not silently undo)

Almost every hard-to-reverse decision is an ADR (`docs/adr/0001` … `0053`, one line each in
`docs/stories/README.md`): read the recent ones before planning, and **amend rather than rewrite** — an ADR
a later story changes gets a "Superseded by ADR-00xx" note (0012/0013, and 0026 amended 0020).

The handful that are **not** in an ADR, and that a fresh session is most likely to undo by accident:

- the default branch stays **`master`** — this repo has no `main`, and renaming it would be an invented
  change;
- **never fake a push**: report the failure instead (§2's loop is how a push actually works);
- **`docs/stories/**` is not edited** — it is the source the Linear issues were imported from; a contract
  that needs changing goes in an ADR;
- the default backend is **`docker`** with the stub opt-in (ADR-0001), so every test and script that boots
  `serve` says which backend it means;
- **S/M stories are implemented in-session; M/L ones go to a worker child with a written brief** (§5);
- the **Linear issue number is not derivable from the story number** — read the title before writing
  `Closes <IDENT>`;
- **one issue per session, then write the state back and stop** (this file's own rule, §5 steps 10–11);
- **nothing a session starts outlives it** — every subagent run, every demo server and every container it
  made is stopped before it stops (§5, step 11). A leftover child is not harmless: it keeps editing a tree
  the next agent has to trust.

## 8. Resume checklist

```bash
cd /home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith
git status --short                                  # clean apart from log.txt/orchestrate.sh
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh                           # ALWAYS before cargo/rustc
python3 /tmp/lin.py issues | grep -v ' Done ' | head # recreate /tmp/lin.py first (§2)
python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-77                    # scoped, Backlog, the issue §1 names
docker version                                      # the daemon must answer, or a Docker check cannot be measured
docker image inspect pi-agent:local                 # the image the Docker stories run
docker network ls | grep -x egress                  # the proxy test's premise (§2)
docker rm -f hs_egress hs_key 2>/dev/null           # so tests/container.rs runs its real path
scripts/verify.sh                                   # baseline green, ~9–12 min (it prints its own counts)
```

If the baseline is red before you touch anything, that is the first thing you fix — and say so in Linear.

Then start §5 on **§1's issue** (`PER-77`, HS-045) and stop after step 11.

Before you begin, check that the last session left nothing behind — `subagent({action:"list"})` should show
no run in progress, `docker ps` none of its containers, and `git status --short` should look like the line
above. If it does not, that is the first thing you fix, and say so in Linear: a tree another session is still
editing is a stop-the-line error, not an inconvenience.

---

## 9. Reporting

The durable record is **Linear** (plan, demo output and ship note per issue), **`docs/review/PER-<n>.md`**
(the review verbatim and its `## Resolution` table) and **`git log`**. Keep a short ledger in the
conversation while the session runs (issue → plan → implement → review → fix → ship) so a restart can see it
from those three; do not carry old sessions' ledgers in this file.

If you stop before the issue ships, say so explicitly, name the next action, and leave the tree clean and the
gates green — **a half-finished story is worse than an honest stop**.

**The last shipped story** (`PER-76`, HS-044, ADR-0053; commits `7c97dbb`, `07b5bb8`, `63892f9`): a crash now
leaves nothing orphaned. `serve` awaits one pass (`src/reconcile.rs`) after the state exists and before the
sweeper and the compactor start: every row that was live at the crash (`starting`, `idle`, `running`) is moved to
`starting` through the table's `crash_recovery` row — with reason `interrupted` when a turn was in flight, and the
re-provision's settle carries it too so the row rests at `idle · interrupted` — then the names no row owns are
removed, and then the sessions are provisioned again. A container `s_<id>` goes unless its row is a `deleting`
delete in progress; an `agents_<id>` network and a `.worktrees/<id>` directory go only when no row has the id;
**never a branch and never a ref** (`git worktree remove --force` plus `remove_dir_all` for an unregistered
directory, `Retained::Unknown` keeps the branch). Docker is read through `--format` and a 16-lowercase-hex check
(`sessions::is_id`) rather than its English or its substring filter, every call is bounded, and the counter the
seq claim rests on got its first reader (`sessions::repository::last_seq`). The pass is awaited rather than
spawned because the demo measured what a task costs (a sweep beside a create takes the create's worktree), and the
sweeper's ordering is the review's P1: a first pass beside the reconcile could stop the row it was bringing back.
V9 passes: a real `kill -9` mid-turn and mid-provision, a restart, `idle · interrupted`, seqs unique and
`last_seq` the log's highest, the container replaced under the same name with a new id, orphans gone. Review *OK
with notes*: two P1s (the sweeper ordering, `docs/build.md`) fixed, one (a Docker-only case SKIPs without a daemon)
dismissed with the run's precedent, three mutations run. The gate also found, not the review: a recovery parks
rows in `starting`, so HS-060's `foldable` had to learn that state or a restarted machine with a day-old log
folded nothing for a tick. Its full record is Linear, `docs/review/PER-76.md` and `git log`; do not carry it
forward.

**One thing this build does not do, recorded rather than discovered:** a resumed session's pi has **no
memory** of earlier turns (`--no-session`; the transcript is Holosmith's log). Replaying the log into a new pi
is a product decision with a token cost and needs its own story — ADR-0040 and ADR-0039 both say so, and
nothing in the backlog owns it yet.
