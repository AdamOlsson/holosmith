# RESUME — one issue per session (next: PER-73 / HS-041, the preview listener)

You are the **orchestrator for implementing Holosmith**. `PROMPT.md` is the standing operating procedure and
still governs the cycle; this file is the state of the world, and it adds one rule of its own:

**This session picks up exactly one issue — the one named in §1.** Take it through the whole cycle (§5):
plan, Linear, implement, gates, demo, review, fix, ship. Then **write the state back** into this file for the
next agent (§5, step 10), with the next issue named in §1, and stop. Do not start a second issue however much
budget is left: a fresh session with a fresh file is how this run continues, and one honest stop beats two
half-finished stories.

The operator is not present. **Never ask a question.** Decide canonically — `HolosmithSpec.md` →
`GLOSSARY.md` → `docs/adr/` → `docs/stories/` → the existing code — record the decision in the Linear issue
and the commit message, and continue.

Read in this order, and no further: **this file**; the issue's slice in `docs/stories/`; the spec items §1
names (and their V-row); the ADR index (one line per decision, `docs/stories/README.md`), then only the ADRs
§1 names; then `docs/notes.md` — the **cross-cutting** section first, then the sections §6 of *this* file
names for this issue. `docs/notes.md` is the durable prose record (the build's shape, the event contract, the
landmines). Anything about a *finished* story is in Linear, `docs/review/PER-<n>.md` and `git log` — not here.

## 0. What this project is

`HolosmithSpec.md` is authoritative. A single-operator system that runs coding agents in containers on
machines you own, driven from a phone. The work is **80 stories** (`HS-001` … `HS-080`) in `docs/stories/`,
one Linear issue each, in five phases:

| Phase | Stories | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — walking skeleton | HS-001 … HS-006 | `docs/stories/phase-0-walking-skeleton.md` |
| 1 — session lifecycle (stub backend) | HS-007 … HS-023 | `docs/stories/phase-1-session-lifecycle-stub.md` |
| 1b — Docker backend | HS-024 … HS-046 | `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md` |
| 2 — deployable MVP | HS-047 … HS-067 | `docs/stories/phase-2-deployable-mvp.md` |
| 3 — multiple machines | HS-068 … HS-074 | `docs/stories/phase-3-multiple-machines.md` |
| 4 — self-development | HS-075 … HS-080 | `docs/stories/phase-4-self-development.md` |

`AGENTS.md` carries the repository rules, including that **Linear scope is exactly one project**: `Holosmith`
(`P-PER-2`, team `Personal`/`PER`). `VulkanRenderAPI` belongs to another repository — never read, create,
comment on, or close anything there.

**Branch `master`** (this repo has **no `main`**; do not rename it). Every commit is pushed; pushing is a
sandbox-specific incantation (§2).

---

## 1. The issue this session picks up: `PER-73` — HS-041, preview listener (V7)

**State when this file was written** (`HEAD` = `origin/master` = `f9626f5`; tree clean apart from the
operator's own `log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`): **46 of 80 stories Done, 34 Backlog**, all in project
`Holosmith`. `PER-73` is `Backlog`, it is the next in `HS-###` order, and its only blocker (`HS-038`,
`PER-70`) is `Done` — so it is eligible. Nothing in the queue is blocked on the machine: the daemon, the
agent image and this build's proxies all work here (§2).

The last shipped story was `PER-72` (HS-040, the credential path — V3–V5 pass against a real key, and the run
found two defects in the key proxy; ADR-0050). Eleven stories have been built against a real `docker run`,
and the last gate run was green.

### 1.1 The slice (verbatim from `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md`; Linear's body is the same text)

> ### HS-041 — Preview listener (V7)
>
> **As** the operator **I want** to open a session's dev server from my phone **so that** I can look at what
> the agent built.
>
> - **Size:** M · **Blocked by:** HS-038 · **Spec:** item 3, V7
> - **Demo:** a stub HTTP server in a container is reachable at `http://<preview-origin>/local/<id>/` from
>   another machine, and a WebSocket through it works.
>
> **Acceptance**
> - [ ] A second listener serves only `/<host>/<id>/*` (HTTP and WebSocket) and has no API routes at all.
> - [ ] WebSocket upgrades check that `Origin` is the preview origin.
> - [ ] Local sessions use the host name `local`; the route is forward-compatible with hub routing (HS-069).
> - [ ] The session screen links to the preview URL for its origin.
> - [ ] **V7 gate:** the host can fetch from a stub HTTP server inside a container on an internal session
>   network; if it cannot, the documented fallback is implemented — the preview proxy runs as a container on
>   the session network — and recorded.

`docs/stories/**` is **not edited** (§7).

### 1.2 The spec it proves

`HolosmithSpec.md` item 3, in full:

> - The server runs a second listener, the preview listener, that serves only `/<host>/<id>/*` (HTTP and
>   WebSocket) and has no API routes. Publish it as its own origin, for example `tailscale serve
>   --https=8444`. The control UI is on 443, so an agent-written dev build can never share an origin with it.
> - WebSocket upgrades on the preview listener check that the Origin is the preview origin.
> - Routing for other machines: the hub's preview listener forwards `/<host>/<id>/*` to that machine's
>   preview listener over the Tailnet, including WebSocket upgrades. Local sessions use the host name
>   `local`.
> - Residual risk: previews of different sessions share the preview origin with each other. Acceptable
>   because they are all yours.

and the spec's own "to verify in the vertical slice" list names this issue's measurement in its own words:
*"that the host can reach a container's IP on an internal network (needed for the preview). Fallback: run
the preview proxy as a container on the session network."* V7's row in the spec's table:

| V | What | Pass | Fallback | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V7 | Host to container reach (item 3) | The host can fetch from a stub HTTP server inside a container on an internal session network | Run the preview proxy as a container on the session network | `not yet run (HS-041)` |

The Result column is HS-040's addition; **this story fills V7's cell.** Also note what item 3 does *not*
require: no auth on previews (the shared-origin risk is accepted in writing), no TLS (that is `tailscale
serve` at deploy time, a phase-2 story), and no HTTP `Origin` check (only *upgrades* are named).

### 1.3 What already exists

- **The two config keys**, validated, golden-filed, banner-printed — the only preview code in the tree:
  - `config.preview_listen: SocketAddr` (default `127.0.0.1:8081`) and `config.preview_origin: Origin`
    (default `http://localhost:8081`) in `src/config/mod.rs`, both in `tests/golden/config-default.toml`;
  - `preview_listen` must differ from `control_listen` and `preview_origin` from `control_origin`
    (`preview_listen_problem` / `preview_origin_problem`), each with a `tests/serve_cli.rs` test.
- **The banner line** `preview_listen 127.0.0.1:8081 (configured, not bound until HS-041)`
  (`src/commands/serve.rs`). Two pinned facts come with it: `tests/serve_cli.rs` asserts **that exact
  string**, and asserts a stub boot's banner is **exactly eight lines** at the default filter. So this story
  rewrites that line (the port will be bound) *and* its assertion, and adds **no** ninth line — a startup
  `info!` fails a gate test (that is why some startup facts are `debug!`).
- **The listener shape to copy**: `serve::run` (listener + `StopSignal` + `ServeOptions` + a bounded drain,
  ADR-0007) and the `Routes`/`App` seam (`src/http/app.rs`, `src/http/mod.rs`): one `axum::serve`, one
  `Router::layer`, both pinned by `tests/guards.rs`. A second listener is a second `App`-shaped value, not a
  second spelling of `axum::serve` in a handler.
- **The container side**: `container::network_name(id)` = `agents_<id>`, created `--internal`;
  `Docker::inspect(name, format)` is the only way to read a container's address; `Docker::running(name)`.
  Two containerised proxies are already joined to every session network under an alias — `hs_egress` as
  `egress-proxy` (`EgressProxy`, ADR-0045) and `hs_key` as `key-proxy` (`KeyProxy`, ADR-0048), joined by the
  **network step**. That is the fallback's machinery, already built and already tested.
- **A byte tunnel without a protocol library**: `src/egress.rs`'s `pump`/`pump_both` (two counted loops over
  a split socket, `AtomicU64` byte counts) and `src/keyproxy.rs`'s `forward`. `egress.rs` is also the model
  for "pure rules, thin tokio layer", and both are modes of this one binary (`holosmith proxy …`) — so the
  fallback, if the measurement demands it, is a third mode, not a second program.
- **The page**: `web/src/main.ts`'s `sessionScreen(id, session)`; anything that is a *rule* (a sentence, a
  path, a state's affordance) belongs in `web/src/transcript.ts` and gets a `web/test/transcript.test.ts`
  case.

### 1.4 What does not exist

Nothing serves `preview_listen`. There is no route table for `/<host>/<id>/*`, no mapping from a session id
to a container address and port, no upgrade handling, no link in `web/`, and **no V7 measurement anywhere**.
Also relevant: `axum` is 0.8 **without its `ws` feature** and `Cargo.lock` holds no WebSocket crate, so an
upgrade is either axum's `ws` (a feature + lock change) or the tunnel spelling above — decide, and say which
and why.

### 1.5 The decision that shapes the design: measure V7 first

Do the measurement **before** the design is fixed, and whatever it says, record it:

1. Start a container on an `--internal` network running a stub HTTP server (the image has node; a
   `node -e` one-liner), take its address from `docker inspect`, and ask **the host** to fetch
   `http://<container ip>:<port>/`.
2. If the host reaches it, the preview listener is an in-process proxy to that address and the rest of the
   issue is small.
3. If it does not, implement the spec's documented fallback: the preview proxy runs **as a container on the
   session network**, the way `hs_egress`/`hs_key` do. How the *host* then reaches that container is the
   second half of the same measurement (a published port, or the container joined to a second network as
   well) — measure both, do not guess. ADR-0044's measured limit is the reason to be careful here: an
   internal network's own gateway *does* answer from inside it, so "the host cannot reach in" and "the
   container cannot reach out" are separate facts.
4. The answer goes into an **ADR** — the next number is **ADR-0051** — and into two indexes in the same
   commit: the ADR list in `docs/stories/README.md` (its count is **fifty** today, and its bullet list, and
   a reviewer checks the links resolve) and, when it changes what the spec claims, the spec's V7 row.

### 1.6 The questions the plan must answer

Answer each with a precedent, and record the answers in the Linear plan comment before any code exists.

1. **The upstream port.** The spec names no port for a container's dev server. In precedent order:
   (a) a config key — then `tests/golden/config-default.toml`, `KNOWN_KEYS.len()` (**31** today, asserted in
   `config/schema.rs`) and `config show`'s re-validation all move in the same commit; (b) the port from
   `docker inspect`'s exposed ports — nothing to configure, the image or the agent decides; (c) a
   per-session column — a schema change, the most expensive of the three. Pick one, justify it.
2. **The path the upstream sees.** `/<host>/<id>/` is a prefix that must be stripped before forwarding, and
   a dev server that emits absolute URLs needs its own base. Say in the ADR what is **not** rewritten, so a
   later story does not believe it was promised.
3. **Which requests are refused.** Item 3 requires the *upgrade's* `Origin` to equal `preview_origin`. Say
   what a plain `GET` with a foreign `Origin` gets (item 3 does not require a check; a preview is readable
   by anyone who can reach the port), what an unknown `host` segment answers (`404` — this build knows only
   `local`; other names are HS-069's), and what a non-`GET`/non-upgrade method gets.
4. **The page's link.** The session screen must link to the preview URL, so the page needs
   `preview_origin` — and both cheap vehicles are pinned **today**: `case_app_shell` compares `GET /`
   byte-for-byte with `web/dist/index.html`, and `GET /api/health` is exactly four keys (`health.rs`'s own
   test *and* `tests/http_contract.rs`). Choose the vehicle, amend that pin **in the same commit** as the
   link, and say why in the ADR. Phase 1b's "nothing may require a UI or API change" is a warning that this
   addition is a *link and nothing else*; the story itself owns the link, so the phase sentence is not a
   veto (contrast ADR-0046, where no element was owed and the copy was cut).
5. **Shutdown and a bind that fails.** The second listener takes the same `StopSignal` and the same bounded
   drain. Decide whether a preview bind that fails is a refusal (the control listener's own shape, one
   sentence naming the fix) or a `warn` (HS-036's precedent: the control UI is the screen an operator needs
   when something else is broken), and justify it in the ADR.

### 1.7 Acceptance, restated as checks

Every bullet needs something that can fail, and at least one of them is a new `case_*` in
`scripts/verify.sh` (§3 — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md`, and the reviewer enforces it).

- *"A second listener serves only `/<host>/<id>/*` and has no API routes."* → a Rust test that drives the
  preview app directly: a path under `/<host>/<id>/` reaches the upstream, `/api/health` and `/api/sessions`
  on the preview port answer `404` (not the envelope), and `/` is not the app shell. Prove it by adding a
  route and watching the test go red.
- *"Upgrades check the `Origin`."* → a test with a hand-written upgrade: the preview origin gets the
  upstream's answer, a foreign origin is refused with a status that is asserted *with* its code, and a
  missing `Origin` has a stated answer.
- *"`local` is the host name; the route is forward-compatible."* → the parse is a named function over the
  path (host segment, id, rest), tested for `local`, an unknown host (404), a malformed id, and a prefix
  strip; the hub (HS-069) then needs no second parser.
- *"The session screen links to the preview URL."* → a `web/test/transcript.test.ts` case for the URL's
  construction (a sentence/path is a rule) plus the wired link in `sessionScreen`, and a `case_*` assertion
  that the page the artifact serves contains the link (the artifact embeds `web/dist`, §3).
- *"V7."* → the measurement itself, performed and pasted verbatim into the Linear ship note, its Result in
  the spec's table, and — where a machine can carry it — a `case_*` that skips properly when there is no
  daemon (one `SKIP` line, and a skip that a deleted feature would *not* produce: a gate case that SKIPs on
  the bug it exists to catch is this project's P1).

Then `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cd web && npm test &&
npx tsc --noEmit`, and `scripts/verify.sh` — all green on a clean tree (§3), plus the story's own demo run
against the **shipped artifact** (§1.9).

### 1.8 Non-goals

- **Hub forwarding** (`/<other-host>/…` → another machine over the Tailnet) is HS-069, phase 2. This issue
  only leaves the route *shapeable* into it.
- **No TLS, no `tailscale serve` configuration, no auth on previews.** Item 3 publishes the listener's
  origin and accepts the shared-origin risk in writing.
- **No dev-server lifecycle.** Starting the agent's build inside the container is the agent's job; nothing
  here starts, watches or stops it.
- **No change to an existing control route**, no new npm dependency, no rewriting of a preview's HTML, and
  no `doctor` check for the preview port (HS-045).
- **No second `axum::serve` in a handler.** The seam in `http/app.rs` is pinned by `tests/guards.rs`.

### 1.9 The demo

The story's demo, from the shipped artifact, on this machine's real daemon: a container on an internal
session network running a stub HTTP server, fetched **from the host** through the preview listener at
`http://<preview-origin>/local/<id>/`, and a WebSocket round trip through the same path. "From another
machine" cannot be faked here — do what is honest and say what you did (a second address of this host, e.g.
`127.0.0.1` and the bridge gateway address, with the container in neither). There is no WebSocket crate and
the image has no `ws` package, so the WebSocket half is a hand-written handshake (`Sec-WebSocket-Key`, expect
`101`) and one frame each way in node or `python3` — dependency-free and sufficient. Bound every background
process, kill it by its own pid, and launch the demo from a script file, not an inline `&` chain.

### 1.10 What the next agent needs back

When you write the state back (§5, step 10): §1 becomes the **next** issue — by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking, that is
`PER-75` (HS-043 — delete hardening and what is kept), then `PER-76` (HS-044), `PER-77` (HS-045) and
`PER-78` (HS-046, the phase-1 verification run that is the gate for phase 2) — with the same shape: slice,
spec, what exists, what does not, the decision that shapes the design, the acceptance as checks, non-goals,
the demo. Update `HEAD`/`origin/master`, the counts, the ADR number you took, the last gate run's own numbers,
and §9's row for this story (short — one paragraph). Anything you learned that is **not** state and **not**
an ADR goes into `docs/notes.md` under a new `### Landmines: …` heading, never into §1.

---

## 2. Environment (already repaired — do not redo)

Everything below lives **outside the repo** and survives. If this is a fresh container, redo it exactly
as written.

```bash
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh      # ALWAYS source this before cargo/rustc
```

It sets `RUSTUP_HOME`, `CARGO_HOME` and `PATH` to:

- rustup 1.99.1, minimal profile + clippy/rustfmt, targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`;
- musl.cc cross toolchains for both arches (`x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`, `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/cc` → `/usr/bin/gcc` (the `cc` crate needs a `cc` on PATH);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/qemu-aarch64-static` (7.2.0) — an **optional dev tool** so the aarch64 artifact
  can actually be *run* here. No repo script may download it; `scripts/check-static.sh` prints one
  `SKIP` line when it is absent and still passes.

Why outside the repo: `/` is a 3.4 GB tmpfs and `~/.pi` is the only large writable ext4 mount.

**Available:** node 24.22.2 / npm 11.19.1 with the npm registry reachable (node 24 strips TypeScript
types natively, which is what `npm test` relies on); `curl`; `python3` (with stdlib `sqlite3` and
`http.client`); `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, `cmp`, `find`, `timeout`, `git`; **Playwright's Chromium**
(`~/.cache/ms-playwright`, bound read-only by `bwrap.sh`) and the `playwright` npm package at
`~/.cache/hs-browser/pw/node_modules`. Two quirks, both hit: ESM **ignores `NODE_PATH`**, so a script
imports the package by its own path — `…/playwright/index.mjs` (the `.js` entry is CJS and its default
export does not have `chromium` at the top level); and Chromium must be launched with
`--no-sandbox`, because its own namespace sandbox cannot nest inside ours. A third, learned in HS-020:
**`networkidle` never settles** on the sessions list, because a live row holds an `EventSource` open —
navigate with `domcontentloaded` and wait for the rows.
**Available since this session: a real Docker daemon.** `docker version` shows a 29.9.2 server, `/var/run/docker.sock` exists,
`docker run` works and images pull over the network. `bwrap.sh` binds the host's socket at
`/var/run/docker.sock` (`DOCKER=()` … `--bind "$sock" /var/run/docker.sock`), so a `docker` inside the
sandbox drives the real daemon — that is host root by another name and it is granted deliberately; a
machine without a socket simply gets no binds. **`pi-agent:local` is loaded and is the image every Docker
story uses**: its pi version equals `pins/pi.txt` exactly (`agent::version_check` asserts it at launch), git
2.39.5, node 24, default user `node` (uid **1000**, the host uid). Everything the Docker chain needs is here,
including network access for `alpine:3` and friends. **A preview demo needs `node` inside the container** —
this image has it, and so must any image `agent_image` points at (HS-036 learned that the hard way: a missing
node is exit 127, not a test failure).

**pi's own RPC documentation is on this machine**:
`~/.pi/agent/install/releases/1.5.0/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` (how to start
it, the JSONL framing rules — one complete JSON object per line, split on LF only, never a reader that also
splits on U+2028), `rpc-commands.md` (the `prompt`/`steer`/`abort`/`get_state` commands and the `disposition`
field), `json.md` (the event stream: `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, tool and message events),
`rpc-extension-ui.md` (the UI requests `pump` auto-cancels) and `environment-variables.md`. The binary in
the image is `/usr/local/bin/pi`, its version already equals `pins/pi.txt`, and `pi --mode rpc --no-session`
is the launch `agent::COMMAND` builds. `pi --help` in the sandbox is the same version's, so an experiment
is free; nothing in the repo may hard-code the path to those documents.

**Not available, and not to be invented:** no `sudo`, no `apt`, no `gh`, no ssh key (the agent has one,
§pushing), no Tailscale. There is a **browser** (`docs/notes.md`, fact 3), but no *gate* may need one.
**No `awk`** and **no `shellcheck`** on this machine — do not write a script or a gate that needs
either.

### Linear access

There are no Linear tools in the tool list. `list_issues` / `save_issue` / `save_comment` / `get_issue`
are reachable through the same HTTP MCP endpoint `scripts/import-linear.py` uses, so drive it from a
wrapper. Recreate `/tmp/lin.py` if it is gone (`/tmp` is ephemeral):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Thin CLI over the Linear MCP server, reusing scripts/import-linear.py plumbing.
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py issues            # id, title, status
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-48      # full issue JSON
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py comment PER-48 FILE
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py state PER-48 "In Progress"
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py states            # the team's states
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py call get_issue '{"id":"PER-48"}'
import importlib.util, json, sys
REPO = '/home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith'
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('imp', REPO + '/scripts/import-linear.py')
imp = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(imp)
PROJECT = 'Holosmith'
a = sys.argv[1:]
if a[0] == 'issues':
    for i in imp.call('list_issues', {'project': PROJECT, 'limit': 250})['issues']:
        print(i['id'], i['status'], i['title'][:70])
elif a[0] == 'issue':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call('get_issue', {'id': a[1]}), indent=2))
elif a[0] == 'comment':
    print(imp.call('save_comment', {'issueId': a[1], 'body': open(a[2]).read()})['id'])
elif a[0] == 'state':
    imp.call('save_issue', {'id': a[1], 'project': PROJECT, 'state': a[2]})
    print(imp.call('get_issue', {'id': a[1]})['status'])
elif a[0] == 'states':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call('list_issue_statuses', {'team': 'PER'}), indent=2))
elif a[0] == 'call':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call(a[1], json.loads(a[2])), indent=2))
```

Always run it with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `rm -rf scripts/__pycache__` afterwards, or you will
leave an untracked `scripts/__pycache__/` behind. `list_issues` on this project returns **80 issues**
(not 250); `grep -v ' Done '` is the quickest way to the unfinished ones.

**Two API traps, both hit already:**

- `save_issue` takes `state` (the **name**, e.g. `"In Progress"`). It rejects `stateId`.
- `get_issue` takes only `id`. Passing `project` is a validation error.

The team's states are `In Review`, `Backlog`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`, `Todo`, `In Progress`.
Never invent a state name.

**Token expiry is routine, not a blocker.** When a call prints `The Linear access token has expired.
Re-authenticate 'linear' in pi.`, refresh it in place — the store keeps a refresh token and a client id:

```python
import json, os, time, urllib.request, urllib.parse
p = os.path.expanduser('~/.pi/agent/mcp-auth.json'); key = 'mcp__linear|https://mcp.linear.app/mcp'
d = json.load(open(p)); e = d[key]
body = urllib.parse.urlencode({'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
                               'refresh_token': e['tokens']['refresh_token'],
                               'client_id': e['clientInformation']['client_id']}).encode()
req = urllib.request.Request(e['discovery']['authorizationServerMetadata']['token_endpoint'],
                            data=body, method='POST',
                            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})
new = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=60).read())
e['tokens'] = {**e['tokens'], **new}
e['tokensExpireAt'] = int((time.time() + int(new.get('expires_in', 3600))) * 1000)
json.dump(d, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
```

If that fails, **stop and report** — that is a `PROMPT.md` stop condition.

---

### Pushing

**Pushing works, through the sandbox's ssh-agent — but the sandbox's own `~/.ssh/config` gets in the
way.** `origin` is `git@github.com:AdamOlsson/holosmith.git`; `bwrap.sh` binds the host's
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at `/run/ssh-agent.sock` (the private key never enters the sandbox), so a push signs on
the host. The bound `~/.ssh/config` has a `Host github.com` block with `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github`, and
that file is **not** in the sandbox, so a plain `git push` fails with
`no such identity: /home/adamolsson/.ssh/github: No such file or directory` / `Permission denied
(publickey)`. It is intermittent — it worked once and failed the next commit — so use the override every
time:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' git push origin master
```

`-F /dev/null` is the load-bearing part: it stops ssh reading the sandbox's `~/.ssh/config` at all, which
is what names the missing key. (A plain `git push` worked once and then stopped; `-c
core.sshCommand='ssh -o IdentityAgent=…'` was not enough either — the config still won.) `ssh -T
git@github.com` with those options answering `Hi AdamOlsson!` is the way to check the agent before
blaming the remote.

**The reliable form offers ONE key.** The agent holds three, and *which* GitHub accepts changes between
sessions — in this session it was the **third**, offered by `sed -n '3p'`, after the first two were rejected
(`ls-remote` succeeded with it once and failed the next time, so retry the loop rather than trusting one
probe). Loop over the three, offer one at a time, and push as soon as one works:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do ssh-add -L | sed -n "${i}p" > /tmp/k.pub
  GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/k.pub \
    -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git" \
    git push origin master && break; done
```

(The older single-key form, for reference:)

```bash
ssh-add -L | sed -n '2p' > /tmp/pushkey.pub
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/pushkey.pub \
  -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' \
  git push origin master
```

(`-i` names a `.pub` that is in the agent: ssh offers exactly that one and signs with the agent's copy.)
`git ls-remote` with the same options is the cheap way to tell "pushed" from "the agent refused again".
Push after every commit that matters, and if a push fails, report it — do not fake one.

## 3. The gates

`. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh` first. Then:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test                          # lib + every test binary; the run prints the counts
cargo test --test schema_previous   # the `migrations` phase, run on its own
cd web && npm test                  # the transcript's rules, node's own runner
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit          # not a gate phase, but a web edit that does not typecheck is a bug
scripts/verify.sh                   # THE one-command gate since HS-006
```

`scripts/verify.sh` runs seven phases, cheapest first: `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, **`migrations`**
(`cargo test --test schema_previous` — the expand/contract rule, HS-075), `build` (`scripts/build.sh`, which
itself runs `build-web.sh` — `npm test` then Vite — and `check-static.sh` last), `embed`
(`scripts/check-embed.sh`), then `serve` — the **shipped musl artifact** booted on `--port 0` with a temp data
dir, running its cases plus a CORS sweep, then torn down with `SIGTERM` and an asserted exit 0. **The run
prints its own case and assertion counts — quote those, never a number copied out of this file.** It takes
~9 min (both musl targets, the Docker cases and `case_idle_stop`'s real minute). `--no-build` skips `build`
and `embed`; `--keep` keeps the work dir.

Some cases bring their own boot, and they are the ones a new story is most likely to collide with:

| Case | What it needs |
| --- | --- |
| `case_token_budget`, `case_usage_survives_resume`, `case_compaction`, `case_history`, `case_backup`, `case_worktree`, `case_worktree_refusal`, `case_agent_launch`, `case_docker_resume`, `case_docker_turn`, `case_internet_toggle` | its own `serve`, and (the last four) the daemon and `agent_image` |
| `case_docker_preflight` | no server at all |
| `case_container_mounts` | no server *and* no daemon — one printed `SKIP` line when there is neither a daemon nor an image |
| `case_exit_classification` | `python3` (it reads a row's `expected_stop` out of `app.db`), skips without it |
| `case_egress_proxy` | **no** server, daemon, internet or key: it starts the artifact as `proxy egress` on a loopback port and asks it four questions over a socket |
| `case_schema_newer` | no daemon; boots the artifact over a schema-99 database |
| `case_key_proxy_request` | a stand-in `openssl` on `PATH`; asserts the bytes the key proxy really sends |

A story is not done until the gates are green on a clean tree, and then you run the story's own demo
yourself and paste its output.

**Every story adds at least one `case_*`** — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md` and the reviewer enforces
it. Two shapes to avoid: a case that *needs* a session created two cases earlier, and a case whose `SKIP`
would also fire when the feature it checks is deleted (§6).

**Run one build at a time.** A `scripts/build.sh` or `scripts/verify.sh` in the same tree while another
one runs can make `check-static.sh`'s banner wait flake under load (it happened once during HS-013: the
gate reported `FAIL build/failed` while the same command passed a minute later, alone). Serialise them.

**Rebuild after committing.** `git describe` is baked into the artifact and `check-static.sh` fails on a
stale `dist/`, so a commit without a rebuild leaves the gate red. Commit, then `scripts/verify.sh`, then
the demo you paste.

**Rebuild after editing `web/`, before any demo.** The artifact embeds `web/dist`, so a demo run against
an artifact built before the page changed is a demo of the *old* page — and it will look like your fix
did nothing. HS-020 lost a demo cycle exactly this way: the fix to `main.ts` was invisible until
`scripts/build.sh` ran again. `scripts/verify.sh` rebuilds, so "gate green, then demo" is the safe order.

  src/turn.rs               the turn runner (HS-015) and the turn timeout (HS-022): touch → the

                            the ladder got there first), or unexpected_exit with the reason. Under a
                            deadline the ladder is *spawned* and the turn keeps being awaited;

  src/ladder.rs             the abort ladder (HS-016): clear_queue → abort → wait out abort_grace →
                            `running → stopped` with the caller's reason → stop. `climb` adds the
                            resume (the abort); `end_turn` returns `Ending::{Asked,Forced}` and does
                            not (the delete, the timeout and the budget). `FORCED_ABORT`
  src/sweeper.rs            the idle stop's task (HS-021): `Sweeper::sweep` (one pass, public for tests),

### What exists and what does not

- **Working:** `version` (text + `--json`), `config {validate,show,edit}`, `serve` (control listener,
  embedded app, `/api/health`, `POST`/`GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/{prompt,abort,steer,resume}`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}[?force=true]`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events`, `…/events/history`, `…/tool-output/{tool_id}`,
  `…/tool-image/{tool_id}/{index}`), SQLite with **four** migrations, the guards, the event writer (which
  coalesces a commit's deltas), the SSE stream, the stub backend and its four-step provisioner, the
  enforced state machine, the abort ladder, the delete flow, the cap with eviction, the create's and the
  resume's three project refusals, the compaction task (which folds a day-old message into one
  `message.snapshot`), the Sessions screen with its create form (which prints a project
  refusal's sentence alone) and the "nothing was deleted" notice, the session screen at
  `/sessions/<id>` with a live transcript and a four-action composer.
- **The agent is real (HS-031) and so is a turn (HS-032 – HS-034).** A Docker create provisions the worktree,
  the network, the attached container running pi in RPC mode, and pi's ready handshake, and ends **`idle`**;
  the agent's directory and the launch line are under the data root, the exit the attached stdio observes is
  classified, and a resume replaces the container and reaches `idle` again. A **prompt** reaches pi, its
  records become the transcript's frames, a tool call's output is filed, and the session's spend is counted —
  with one gap a real container still shows: pi refuses a `prompt` before a stream exists, because a session's
  network is `--internal`, its pi-home has only a dummy key, and the gate's machine stores no provider key, so
  `case_docker_turn` asserts pi's own refusal sentence and the streaming evidence is the committed fixtures —
  while HS-040's recorded run is the evidence that a real turn works end to end through the key proxy (text and
  thinking deltas, a tool round trip, usage), because the gate may not hold a provider key.
- **The egress proxy exists and is the only route out (HS-037).** `holosmith proxy egress` is a mode of the
  artifact; a Docker boot starts `hs_egress` on `egress` (bounded, `warn` on failure) and the network step
  joins it to a session's network under the alias `egress-proxy` **only when the row's `network` flag is set**,
  so `HTTPS_PROXY` is the same string either way and the difference is topology. HS-038 measured that (the boot's
  bare/joined pair and `case_internet_toggle`) and left the **copy** under the checkbox to whoever next owns the
  create form, because a new element is a UI change in a phase that forbids one (ADR-0046).
- **The migration rule has two halves and both are enforced (HS-075).** `schema::contract_violations` refuses an
  unmarked destructive statement in a migration (`cargo test`), and `tests/schema_previous.rs` refuses a drop or a
  rename against `docs/schema/previous.sql` — the gate calls the second the `migrations` **phase**. Refreshing
  that snapshot is a **release step** (`scripts/schema-snapshot.sh`), not a story's, and a contract migration
  changes it in the same commit. `schema::verdict` is the sentence `serve` warns with on a newer database and
  `doctor` will refuse with (ADR-0047).
- **What is left of the network half:** the preview listener (HS-041), the delete's keep-rules (HS-043),
  startup reconcile (HS-044), `doctor` (HS-045), the phase-1 verification run (HS-046), merge, publish, the hub,
  releases, the stopped-session expiry (HS-064), and any **delete affordance in `web/`** (the API has the
  endpoint; the page has no button). The key proxy (HS-039) and its **verification** (HS-040 — V3, V4 and V5 all
  pass, and the run found and fixed two defects) and the WIP snapshot (HS-042) are done, and the spec's
  verification table has a **Result** column that HS-046 finishes filling.
- **The log is now read in two shapes and written by two producers of two kinds.** The stream replays a
  *window* (`history_window`, default 50) and says so with `history.truncated`; `GET …/events/history`
  answers the frames below that cursor. `events/stream.rs`'s `REPLAY_LIMIT` is still `u32::MAX` — it is
  "everything from the cut", and a second window there would be an invisible truncation. The project
  backup is a second *writer* of files under the data root (`<data>/backups/`), not of the database.
- **A stop is now recorded as the server's own, and a clean exit has its own state row — observed.**
  `Stopper` writes `expected_stop` before the `docker stop`, and `Exits::record` turns an exit into `stopped`
  (expected), `stopped · pi_exit` (code 0, no flag) or `error` + the last stderr lines. Since HS-031 its
  caller is the task the provisioner spawns after a successful pi step, fed by the backend's `ExitWatcher`
  (ADR-0039). Do not "fix" anything by adding a `docker events` watcher: the attached process *is* the
  observation.
- **Four policies can now stop something and they must not be confused:** the cap evicts (`evicted`,
  inside a create), the sweeper stops a quiet one (`idle_stop`, on its own tick), the turn timeout ends a
  *turn* (`turn_timeout`, from the runner) and the token budget ends a *turn* (`budget_exceeded`, also from
  the runner, on one `fired` shared with the timeout so only one climb happens). All of them go through
  `Transitioner::apply`, and the row moves before the container in every one of them.
- **`runtime::Backend`** has `Stub` and `Docker`; `serve --backend` and the config key `backend` select
  it. `DockerBackend::new(ContainerSettings)` provisions all four steps, runs a turn's five operations and
  implements the WIP snapshot. The default backend is **`docker`** (ADR-0001: the stub is opt-in), so a
  default build provisions a session to `error` with a reason rather than hanging in `starting`, and
  `scripts/verify.sh` boots with `backend = "stub"` in its config (so does `scripts/check-static.sh`'s
  empty-root run, because a Docker run refuses at startup on a machine that fails the preflight, HS-024, and
  that sandbox has no daemon, no `git` and no `df`). (Since HS-026 a create for a project that is not a plain
  checkout is refused earlier, with a 422; the demo trick HS-019 used still works for a project that *is*
  one — which is also how HS-019 provoked a real failed snapshot from the shipped artifact.)
- **`AppState`** is `{ config, runtime, database: Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Database>>, events: EventWriter,
  streams: StreamRegistry, backend: Backends }`, with **seven** wiring helpers — `provisioner()`,
  `turner()`, `transitioner()`, `ladder()`, `deleter()`, `sweeper()` (an `Option`, `None` when
  `idle_stop_min` is 0) and `compactor()` (always `Some`). The mutex is an explicit stopgap
  (ADR-0012/0013; `docs/notes.md`'s *Data and state* landmines).
- **`sessions::state::Transitioner::apply`** is the only way a session's state changes; `apply_logged`
  is the runners' wrapper (log, never return). A provisioning step report is `from == to` with `step`
  set and is *not* a table row.
- **The create is one lock scope plus a loop.** `create_locked` answers `Slot::{Inserted, Existing,
  Full}`; a `Full` makes `slot_for` evict one idle session (through `apply`, which takes the lock
  itself) and try again. Idempotency is checked first, so a retry never evicts anyone. `evict_one`
  moves the row **before** it spawns the backend's `stop`, because the row is what frees the slot.
- **`config`** has (`31` keys now) `agent_image` (default `agent-image:<binary version>`; this machine's
  demos and the gate set `pi-agent:local`), `container_cpus` (2), `container_memory_mb` (4096),
  `container_pids` (512) — all three **refuse `0`** — plus `abort_grace` (default `10s`, **used** by the ladder), `idle_stop_min`,
  `stopped_ttl_days`, `min_free_gb`, `turn_timeout_min`, `max_session_tokens` and the rest — check
  `config show` before adding a key. The delete flow and **compaction** have **no** config key of their
  own (the 24-hour window is a constant), and `max_live_sessions` (default 3, ≥ 1) is the cap.
- **`POST /resume`** takes the transition, then spawns the provisioner, and **touches `last_active_at`**
  (a resumed session must not be the eviction's first candidate — which is now a real policy, not a
  future one). The cap is checked **before** the transition, and the resume answers `409 cap_reached`
  rather than evicting (ADR-0022, ADR-0024). `SessionBackend::resume` has had a body since HS-029 and is how
  a `stopped` row comes back.

## 5. The cycle — one issue, then write the state back

Everything is **sequential: one writer at a time**, never two children editing files. Review children are
read-only and may run in parallel.

1. **Confirm the issue.** Read §1's slice, the Linear body (`python3 /tmp/lin.py issue <IDENT>`, §2) and the
   spec items. **Check the issue's title against the story you mean** — the Linear number is not derivable
   from the `HS-` number (HS-059 is `PER-91`, not `PER-93`; a session wrote `Closes PER-93` for it and had to
   record the correction in three places). Note `HEAD` — that SHA is the review's fixed point.
2. **Plan.** For an **L** story, give a fresh `delegate` child a grilling brief
   (`~/.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` + `domain-modeling`): it puts **one** round of questions to *you*
   via `contact_supervisor`, and you answer with `subagent_supervisor({action:"reply", …})`. For **S/M**
   (HS-041 is M), write the plan yourself — it is faster and the analysis is usually already done. Either
   way: state the environment facts, name the files to read, list the decisions already settled, and
   **pre-answer the obvious round-2 questions**. A planner may write only `GLOSSARY.md` and a new
   `docs/adr/*.md`.
3. **Record in Linear before any code exists**: `save_comment` with the plan shape, a decisions→precedent
   table, the acceptance restated as testable checks, the non-goals, the docs touched, the demo, and the
   follow-ups; then `state` the issue `In Progress` and re-read it to confirm.
4. **Implement.** Two proven patterns: **S/M in-session** (most stories since HS-016), or **M/L with a lot
   of new surface** handed to a fresh `worker` child with a *written* brief — the plan plus the "how", the
   ground rules (no commit, no Linear, no new dependency, `env.sh` first, don't edit `docs/stories/**`), the
   exact gate commands, and "budget discipline: keep the tree compiling; if you run long, stop green and
   report which steps remain". Twice a child found a genuine contradiction in the brief — verify its claims
   rather than trusting them.
5. **Verify yourself.** Never trust a child's pasted output: run the gates and the demo. This has caught
   something every time (a wrong count, a demo-revealed message bug, a panic path, an assertion that passed
   over an already-stopped row).
6. **Review** with a fresh `reviewer` child running `~/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, read-only,
   against `<fixed point>...HEAD` plus untracked files, spec axis sourced from the Linear body + story slice
   + spec items. `git add -A` first and write `git diff --cached <fp>` to
   `/tmp/holosmith/reviews/PER-73-diff.txt` so new files appear. **The reviewer has no shell and no write
   tool**: check its claims, and *you* save the review verbatim to `docs/review/PER-73.md`. **Commit before
   launching it** — a child reading a tree that moves under it stalls.
7. **Fix** in the same session (or with a fresh `worker`), triaging every finding as fixed or
   dismissed-with-citation; a "won't fix" without a citation is not acceptable. Re-run the gates. Append a
   `## Resolution` table to the review file and commit it with the fixes. If a claim cannot be dismissed,
   mutate the code and watch the guarding test go red before believing it.
8. **Ship**: focused conventional commits that name the issue, the last one ending `Closes <IDENT>` (§1's
   identifier). Commit messages are prose about *why*, not a restatement of the diff — look at the last few
   for tone. Rebuild after committing (§3). Then `save_comment` with what shipped, the gates, the verbatim
   demo output, the acceptance item by item and the follow-ups; set the issue `Done`; re-read it to confirm.
9. **Push**, with the sandbox's single-key loop (§2). If the push fails, report it — never fake one.
10. **Write the state back and stop.** Rewrite §1 of this file for the next issue (§1.10's shape), refresh
    `HEAD`/`origin/master`, the counts, the ADR number, the last gate run's numbers and §9's row, then commit
    that with the message `Refresh the handoff after <IDENT>`. Then stop — do not pick up the next issue, even
    if it is small and eligible. Set §1's replacement by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking (Linear priority → `HS-###`
    order → anything already `In Progress` → skip an issue whose `Blocked by` stories are not `Done`).

Working artifacts (`/tmp` is ephemeral; the durable record is Linear + `docs/review/` + `git log`):

```text
/tmp/holosmith/plans/PER-<n>.md            the plan
/tmp/holosmith/plans/PER-<n>-linear.md     the Linear comment body
/tmp/holosmith/plans/PER-<n>-impl-brief.md the implementer's brief

## 6. Which notes bear on this issue

The catalogue lives in **`docs/notes.md`** — read the **cross-cutting** sections before you start anything,
then the sections below. It is a reference: everything there is a measurement or a review finding.

| Read | Why it bears on a preview listener |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-cutting: *Build and toolchain*, *Tests*, *HTTP and the envelope*, *Web*, *Config and docs*, *Reviews*, *Demos* | True of every story. The demo and the gate-case rules are where preview work is most likely to go wrong. |
| *Landmines: Docker — mounts, containers, starts* | A container name is `s_<id>`, a network's is `agents_<id>`, `docker inspect` is the only place real flags and addresses are visible, and a path the daemon cannot see is not a mount. |
| *Landmines: the network self-test* / *the egress proxy* / *the checkbox's pair* | The internal-network and alias facts this issue measures against, including the one thing an internal network's gateway *does* answer (ADR-0044). |
| *Landmines: the agent launch* | The data root must be host-visible, the container appears seconds after the step returns, and a killed CLI does not stop its container. |
| *Landmines: project refusals and coalescing* / *compaction* / *history and backup* | The gate's own traps: the cap is one live session, a case that makes a session must delete it, `local a=… b="$a"` is unbound under `set -u`. |
| `docs/notes.md` §"The transcript's contract" | Not this issue's subject, but it is the contract the next story will assume. |

Three rules worth repeating here because they are the most expensive to relearn: **a test that cannot fail
is worse than no test** (mutate the behaviour and watch it go red); **a gate case that SKIPs on the bug it
exists to catch is this project's P1**; and **after any scripted Markdown edit, read the changed lines** —
three such edits have cost a review finding each.

## 7. Decisions taken on the operator's behalf (do not silently undo)

Almost every hard-to-reverse decision is an ADR (`docs/adr/0001` … `0050`, one line each in
`docs/stories/README.md`): read the recent ones before planning, and **amend rather than rewrite** — an ADR
a later story changes gets a "Superseded by ADR-00xx" note (0012/0013, and 0026 amended 0020).

The handful that are **not** in an ADR, and that a fresh session is most likely to undo by accident:

- the default branch stays **`master`** — this repo has no `main`, and renaming it would be an invented
  change;
- **never fake a push**: report the failure instead (§2's loop is how a push actually works);
- **`docs/stories/**` is not edited** — it is the source the Linear issues were imported from; a contract
  that needs changing goes in an ADR;
- the default backend is **`docker`** with the stub opt-in (ADR-0001), so every test and script that boots
  `serve` says which backend it means;
- **S/M stories are implemented in-session; M/L ones go to a worker child with a written brief** (§5);
- the **Linear issue number is not derivable from the story number** — read the title before writing
  `Closes <IDENT>`;
- **one issue per session, then write the state back and stop** (this file's own rule, §5 step 10).

## 8. Resume checklist

```bash
cd /home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith
git status --short                                  # clean apart from log.txt/orchestrate.sh
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh                           # ALWAYS before cargo/rustc
python3 /tmp/lin.py issues | grep -v ' Done ' | head # recreate /tmp/lin.py first (§2)
python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-73                    # scoped, Backlog, the issue §1 names
docker version                                      # the daemon must answer, or V7 cannot be measured
docker image inspect pi-agent:local                 # the image the Docker stories run
scripts/verify.sh                                   # baseline green, ~9–12 min (it prints its own counts)
```

If the baseline is red before you touch anything, that is the first thing you fix — and say so in Linear.

Then start §5 on **§1's issue** (`PER-73`, HS-041) and stop after step 10.

## 9. Reporting

The durable record is **Linear** (plan, demo output and ship note per issue), **`docs/review/PER-<n>.md`**
(the review verbatim and its `## Resolution` table) and **`git log`**. Keep a short ledger in the
conversation while the session runs (issue → plan → implement → review → fix → ship) so a restart can see it
from those three; do not carry old sessions' ledgers in this file.

If you stop before the issue ships, say so explicitly, name the next action, and leave the tree clean and the
gates green — **a half-finished story is worse than an honest stop**.

**The last shipped story** (`PER-72`, HS-040, ADR-0050; commits `4d0340f`, `5334b7f`, `ceab154`, handoff
`f9626f5`): V3, V4 and V5 pass against a real provider key, and the run found two defects in the key proxy,
both fixed — `upstream` returned a `Content-Length` with no body behind it, and `hs_key` mounted
`keys.toml` as a *file* that a temp-file-and-rename store cannot reach. Review *OK with notes*, no P1. Demo:
15/15 claims against the shipped artifact on a real daemon. Its full record is Linear and
`docs/review/PER-72.md`; do not carry it forward.

**One thing this build does not do, recorded rather than discovered:** a resumed session's pi has **no
memory** of earlier turns (`--no-session`; the transcript is Holosmith's log). Replaying the log into a new pi
is a product decision with a token cost and needs its own story — ADR-0040 and ADR-0039 both say so, and
nothing in the backlog owns it yet.
