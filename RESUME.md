# RESUME — one issue per session (next: PER-75 / HS-043, delete keeps what is worth keeping)

You are the **orchestrator for implementing Holosmith**. `PROMPT.md` is the standing operating procedure and
still governs the cycle; this file is the state of the world, and it adds one rule of its own:

**This session picks up exactly one issue — the one named in §1.** Take it through the whole cycle (§5):
plan, Linear, implement, gates, demo, review, fix, ship, **write the state back** into this file for the next
agent (§5, step 10), then **kill every child you started** and stop (§5, step 11). Do not start a second issue
however much budget is left: a fresh session with a fresh file is how this run continues, and one honest stop
beats two half-finished stories.

The operator is not present. **Never ask a question.** Decide canonically — `HolosmithSpec.md` →
`GLOSSARY.md` → `docs/adr/` → `docs/stories/` → the existing code — record the decision in the Linear issue
and the commit message, and continue.

Read in this order, and no further: **this file**; the issue's slice in `docs/stories/`; the spec items §1
names (and their V-row); the ADR index (one line per decision, `docs/stories/README.md`), then only the ADRs
§1 names; then `docs/notes.md` — the **cross-cutting** section first, then the sections §6 of *this* file
names for this issue. `docs/notes.md` is the durable prose record (the build's shape, the event contract, the
landmines). Anything about a *finished* story is in Linear, `docs/review/PER-<n>.md` and `git log` — not here.

## 0. What this project is

`HolosmithSpec.md` is authoritative. A single-operator system that runs coding agents in containers on
machines you own, driven from a phone. The work is **80 stories** (`HS-001` … `HS-080`) in `docs/stories/`,
one Linear issue each, in five phases:

| Phase | Stories | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — walking skeleton | HS-001 … HS-006 | `docs/stories/phase-0-walking-skeleton.md` |
| 1 — session lifecycle (stub backend) | HS-007 … HS-023 | `docs/stories/phase-1-session-lifecycle-stub.md` |
| 1b — Docker backend | HS-024 … HS-046 | `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md` |
| 2 — deployable MVP | HS-047 … HS-067 | `docs/stories/phase-2-deployable-mvp.md` |
| 3 — multiple machines | HS-068 … HS-074 | `docs/stories/phase-3-multiple-machines.md` |
| 4 — self-development | HS-075 … HS-080 | `docs/stories/phase-4-self-development.md` |

`AGENTS.md` carries the repository rules, including that **Linear scope is exactly one project**: `Holosmith`
(`P-PER-2`, team `Personal`/`PER`). `VulkanRenderAPI` belongs to another repository — never read, create,
comment on, or close anything there.

**Branch `master`** (this repo has **no `main`**; do not rename it). Every commit is pushed; pushing is a
sandbox-specific incantation (§2).

---

## 1. The issue this session picks up: `PER-75` — HS-043, delete hardening and what is kept

**State when this file was written** (`HEAD` = `origin/master` = `ae80439`; tree clean apart from the operator's
own `log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`): **47 of 80 stories Done, 33 Backlog**, all in project `Holosmith`. `PER-75` is
`Backlog`, it is the next in `HS-###` order, and its only blocker (`HS-042`, `PER-74`) is `Done` — so it is
eligible. Nothing in the queue is blocked on the machine: the daemon, the agent image and this build's proxies all
work here (§2).

The last shipped story was `PER-73` (HS-041, the preview listener — V7 **passes**; the listener is the binary's
third byte tunnel; ADR-0051). Twelve stories have been built against a real `docker run`, and the last gate run was
green: **62 cases, 650 assertions**.

### 1.1 The slice (verbatim from `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md`; Linear's body is the same text)

> ### HS-043 — Delete hardening and what is kept
>
> **As** the operator **I want** delete to keep whatever is worth keeping **so that** "delete" is not a synonym
> for "lose".
>
> - **Size:** M · **Blocked by:** HS-042 · **Spec:** item 9
> - **Demo:** delete a session with unmerged commits and an uncommitted change; the branch and the wip ref are
>   still there and the recovery command is printed.
>
> **Acceptance**
> - [ ] Snapshot runs before delete; failure → 409 `unsaved_work` unless `?force=true`.
> - [ ] Branch `agent/<id>` is kept when it has commits beyond base and is not merged into a target branch.
> - [ ] `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` is kept when it differs from the branch.
> - [ ] The delete response and the UI show the recovery command: `git branch rescue refs/holosmith/wip/<id>`.
> - [ ] Worktree, session directory and network are removed; the row is deleted last.

`docs/stories/**` is **not edited** (§7).

### 1.2 The spec it proves

`HolosmithSpec.md` item 9, the parts this story owns:

> - Delete flow (returns 202, state `deleting`): abort if running; snapshot; `docker stop`; `git worktree remove
>   --force`; remove the session directory and network; delete the row. If the snapshot fails, delete returns 409
>   `unsaved_work` unless `?force=true`.
> - Kept in the repository: branch `agent/<id>` if it has commits beyond the base and is not merged into a target
>   branch, and `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` if it differs from the branch. Recover with `git branch rescue
>   refs/holosmith/wip/<id>`.

Note what item 9 does **not** ask for: no fetch of the worktree's files, no bundle, no new config key (the targets
are `[merge] targets`, which already exists), and no change to *how* a delete is requested.

### 1.3 What already exists

- **The whole delete flow except the keep-rules.** `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}[?force=true]`
  (`http/sessions.rs::delete`) ends a running turn through the ladder's `end_turn` (reason `deleted`), takes the
  snapshot, answers `409 unsaved_work` when it fails and the request did not force, applies `Trigger::Delete`, and
  answers **202 with the row**. The removal is `Deleter::spawn` (`src/deleter.rs`, ADR-0023): revoke the session's
  dummy key (HS-039, `key::Store::revoke`) → `backend.delete` (container, worktree, session directory, network) →
  the row **and its event log in one transaction** → close the session's streams. `DELETED` is the ladder's word.
- **`worktree::Worktree::remove` deletes the branch unconditionally**, and that is the one line this story changes:
  `worktree remove --force` (when registered) → `git branch -D` (when the branch exists) → `git worktree prune`.
  Its doc says so; `tests/worktree.rs` is where a real repository is used (`support` has `repository`/`git`/`head`/
  `branch_exists`/`worktrees`).
- **The two facts the keep-rule needs**: `Worktree::ahead` (a `git rev-list --count <base>..agent/<id>`) answers
  "commits beyond the base", and `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> <target>` (not yet used anywhere) answers
  "already merged". `Worktree` is sync and std-only and the backend calls it on `spawn_blocking`.
- **The WIP ref**: `src/snapshot.rs` (HS-042, ADR-0049) writes `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` from a temporary index,
  **removes** it when the tree equals `HEAD`, and exposes `REF_PREFIX`/`reference(id)`. Nothing deletes it today,
  so "kept" is already true for the ref; what is missing is the *report* and the comparison against the branch.
- **The merge targets** are a validated config key: `[merge] targets` (default `["main", "master"]`), read by
  nothing yet — item 12's stories (HS-054…HS-057) will be its first other reader.
- **The page has no delete affordance at all**: `web/src/main.ts` draws the session screen and the composer, the
  API has `DELETE`, and `case_delete_session` drives it over HTTP. The sentences live in `web/src/transcript.ts`
  (`stoppedNotice`, `stoppedDetail`, `createFailure`), each with a `web/test/transcript.test.ts` case.
- **The delete's own gate case** is `case_delete_session` (`scripts/verify.sh`): 202 → `deleting` → the row that is
  gone, and `case_delete_without_the_client_header` for the guard.

### 1.4 What does not exist

No keep-rule (the branch always goes), no merged-into-a-target check, no comparison of the wip ref against the
branch, nothing on the delete response beyond the row, no recovery sentence anywhere in `web/`, **no delete button
on any screen**, and no test that asserts a branch *survives* a delete.

### 1.5 The decisions that shape the design

1. **Where the keep-rule lives.** `Worktree::remove` is the function that deletes the branch, so the rule is either
   inside it (`remove` takes "what to keep") or in `Deleter` (which would have to run git itself, in a module that
   has none). The precedent is ADR-0029: one `worktree.rs` value holds every host git command. Recommend: a value
   the rule answers (`Retained { branch: bool, wip: bool }` plus the sentences/commands it implies) computed by
   `worktree.rs` from the repository, and `remove` told what not to delete — so `tests/worktree.rs` can prove the
   rule on a real repo without a daemon, a backend or a delete request.
2. **"Not merged into a target branch"**. `--is-ancestor` per target, and a target that does not exist in this
   repository is not a merge (a machine may have only `main` or only `master`; the default list names both). Say in
   the ADR what a repository with neither does — the branch is kept, because "cannot tell" must not mean "delete".
3. **The response's shape.** The row is the API body everywhere (ADR-0038 kept `expected_stop` off the wire for
   that reason). The story asks for the recovery command *in the delete response*, so decide the vehicle: an
   additive key on the 202 (recommended — it is the delete's own answer, and no other route has to carry it), or a
   new route/field on the row. Amend the contract test in the same commit either way.
4. **The UI half, and the button it implies.** "The delete response **and the UI** show the recovery command" cannot
   be satisfied without an affordance: the page has no delete button today. Decide whether this story adds one (with
   the notice) or records the gap in the ADR and leaves the button to whoever owns the screen next. The phase-1b
   "nothing may require a UI change" sentence is a warning, not a veto: the story names the UI, so it owns it
   (contrast ADR-0046, where no element was owed and the copy was cut).
5. **What "kept" means for the ref when the tree equals HEAD.** `Snapshot::take` **removes** the ref in that case
   (ADR-0049), so a delete after such a snapshot has nothing to keep and must not print a recovery command for a ref
   that is not there. The rule is "kept when it differs from the branch", which is exactly what the snapshot's own
   `Taken::Removed` records.

### 1.6 The questions the plan must answer

Answer each with a precedent, and record the answers in the Linear plan comment before any code exists.

1. **Which branch name survives, and what the base is.** The keep-rule is "commits beyond the base": the row's
   `base_commit` is what `ahead` already uses, but a resume re-provisions and a row written by an older binary may
   have no `base_commit`. Say which wins (`ahead`'s `base_commit.or(branch head)` rule is already written down).
2. **What the operator is told.** One sentence naming the branch, one naming the ref and the exact recovery
   command, and where they are shown (the 202's body and the page). The command is the spec's:
   `git branch rescue refs/holosmith/wip/<id>`.
3. **What a delete of a *stopped* or *error* session keeps** — the same rules, because the branch and the ref
   outlive the container; a session that never ran has nothing ahead of its base, so it keeps nothing.
4. **What `?force=true` does to the keep-rules**: nothing. Force forgives a failed snapshot; it does not decide what
   is deleted from the repository.
5. **The order in `Deleter`.** The row is deleted last (already). Where the keep-rule's answer comes from — computed
   before the backend's teardown, because after it the worktree is gone (and `ahead` needs it) — and how a failure
   to read the repository is reported (a `warn`, and then *keep*: never delete on an unanswered question).

### 1.7 Acceptance, restated as checks

Every bullet needs something that can fail, and at least one of them is a new `case_*` in `scripts/verify.sh`
(§3 — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md`, and the reviewer enforces it).

- *"Snapshot before delete; failure → 409 `unsaved_work` unless forced"* — already implemented (HS-019/042);
  the story re-asserts it and must not regress it: `tests/delete.rs` and `case_delete_session`. If the snapshot's
  result now decides the answer, the pair (`Taken::Written` / `Taken::Removed`) is where.
- *"Branch kept when ahead of base and not merged into a target"* — `tests/worktree.rs` on a real repository: a
  branch with a commit ahead of `main` survives `remove`; a branch merged into `main` does not; a branch with no
  commits beyond its base does not; a repository with only `master` (no `main`) keeps the unmerged branch.
  Prove each by deleting the guard and watching the test go red.
- *"`refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` kept when it differs from the branch"* — a test that takes a snapshot with an
  uncommitted change, runs the teardown, and asserts the ref is still there (`git rev-parse`) while a snapshot whose
  tree `equals` HEAD leaves no ref and therefore no command.
- *"The response and the UI show the recovery command"* — an assertion on the 202's body (the exact command, with
  the session's id) plus a `web/test/transcript.test.ts` case for the sentence/rule, plus the wired element, plus a
  `case_*` assertion that the shipped page carries it (the artifact embeds `web/dist`, §3).
- *"Worktree, session directory and network are removed; the row is deleted last"* — already implemented and
  already gated (`case_delete_session`, `tests/delete.rs`); the story must keep the *order* (the row's removal is
  the last step of `Deleter`) and prove the branch's survival does not keep the worktree.

Then `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cd web && npm test &&
npx tsc --noEmit`, and `scripts/verify.sh` — all green on a clean tree (§3), plus the story's own demo run against
the **shipped artifact** (§1.9).

### 1.8 Non-goals

- **Merge itself** (`merge`/`squash`/fast-forward) is HS-054 – HS-057. This story only *reads* whether a merge
  happened.
- **Publish** (HS-057), the **Changes view** (HS-052/HS-053), the **Changes sheet** (HS-058).
- **No bundle, no archive, no `git gc`**: item 9 names two refs and no file.
- **No new config key**: `[merge] targets` already exists and is validated.
- **No expiry** of a kept branch or ref (HS-064 owns stopped-session expiry, and this story's refs are not a row).
- **No change to how a delete is requested** (the route, the query, the 202) beyond the additive key the story owns.

### 1.9 The demo

Delete a session with unmerged commits and an uncommitted change, from the shipped artifact on this machine's real
daemon: create a session against a real project (a plain checkout, ADR-0030), let it reach `idle`, then make a
commit on `agent/<id>` in the worktree and leave a file modified (the agent's own work is simulated — say so), call
`DELETE`, and show: the 202's body carrying the recovery command, `git branch -a` still holding `agent/<id>`,
`git rev-parse refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` still answering, the worktree and the session directory gone, and
`git branch rescue refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` succeeding against the kept ref. Bound every background process, kill it
by its own pid, **and remove every container and network the demo made in the script's trap** (§6's newest
landmine: the last session's demo left a container behind because its trap only killed `serve`).

### 1.10 What the next agent needs back

When you write the state back (§5, step 10): §1 becomes the **next** issue — by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking, that is
`PER-76` (HS-044 — startup reconcile and crash safety, V9), then `PER-77` (HS-045 — `doctor`), `PER-78` (HS-046,
the phase-1 verification run that is the gate for phase 2) — with the same shape: slice, spec, what exists, what
does not, the decision that shapes the design, the acceptance as checks, non-goals, the demo. Refresh the counts,
the ADR number you took (**ADR-0052** is next) and the last gate run's own numbers, and replace §9's row with this
story's (short — one paragraph). Anything you learned that is **not** state and **not** an ADR goes into
`docs/notes.md` under a new `### Landmines: …` heading, never into §1. Then kill what you started (§5, step 11) —
a session that leaves a child or a container behind blocks the next one.

## 2. Environment (already repaired — do not redo)

Everything below lives **outside the repo** and survives. If this is a fresh container, redo it exactly
as written.

```bash
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh      # ALWAYS source this before cargo/rustc
```

It sets `RUSTUP_HOME`, `CARGO_HOME` and `PATH` to:

- rustup 1.99.1, minimal profile + clippy/rustfmt, targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`;
- musl.cc cross toolchains for both arches (`x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`, `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/cc` → `/usr/bin/gcc` (the `cc` crate needs a `cc` on PATH);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/qemu-aarch64-static` (7.2.0) — an **optional dev tool** so the aarch64 artifact
  can actually be *run* here. No repo script may download it; `scripts/check-static.sh` prints one
  `SKIP` line when it is absent and still passes.

Why outside the repo: `/` is a 3.4 GB tmpfs and `~/.pi` is the only large writable ext4 mount.

**Available:** node 24.22.2 / npm 11.19.1 with the npm registry reachable (node 24 strips TypeScript
types natively, which is what `npm test` relies on); `curl`; `python3` (with stdlib `sqlite3` and
`http.client`); `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, `cmp`, `find`, `timeout`, `git`; **Playwright's Chromium**
(`~/.cache/ms-playwright`, bound read-only by `bwrap.sh`) and the `playwright` npm package at
`~/.cache/hs-browser/pw/node_modules`. Two quirks, both hit: ESM **ignores `NODE_PATH`**, so a script
imports the package by its own path — `…/playwright/index.mjs` (the `.js` entry is CJS and its default
export does not have `chromium` at the top level); and Chromium must be launched with
`--no-sandbox`, because its own namespace sandbox cannot nest inside ours. A third, learned in HS-020:
**`networkidle` never settles** on the sessions list, because a live row holds an `EventSource` open —
navigate with `domcontentloaded` and wait for the rows.
**Available since this session: a real Docker daemon.** `docker version` shows a 29.9.2 server, `/var/run/docker.sock` exists,
`docker run` works and images pull over the network. `bwrap.sh` binds the host's socket at
`/var/run/docker.sock` (`DOCKER=()` … `--bind "$sock" /var/run/docker.sock`), so a `docker` inside the
sandbox drives the real daemon — that is host root by another name and it is granted deliberately; a
machine without a socket simply gets no binds. **`pi-agent:local` is loaded and is the image every Docker
story uses**: its pi version equals `pins/pi.txt` exactly (`agent::version_check` asserts it at launch), git
2.39.5, node 24, default user `node` (uid **1000**, the host uid). Everything the Docker chain needs is here,
including network access for `alpine:3` and friends. **A preview demo needs `node` inside the container** —
this image has it, and so must any image `agent_image` points at (HS-036 learned that the hard way: a missing
node is exit 127, not a test failure).

**pi's own RPC documentation is on this machine**:
`~/.pi/agent/install/releases/1.5.0/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` (how to start
it, the JSONL framing rules — one complete JSON object per line, split on LF only, never a reader that also
splits on U+2028), `rpc-commands.md` (the `prompt`/`steer`/`abort`/`get_state` commands and the `disposition`
field), `json.md` (the event stream: `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, tool and message events),
`rpc-extension-ui.md` (the UI requests `pump` auto-cancels) and `environment-variables.md`. The binary in
the image is `/usr/local/bin/pi`, its version already equals `pins/pi.txt`, and `pi --mode rpc --no-session`
is the launch `agent::COMMAND` builds. `pi --help` in the sandbox is the same version's, so an experiment
is free; nothing in the repo may hard-code the path to those documents.

**Not available, and not to be invented:** no `sudo`, no `apt`, no `gh`, no ssh key (the agent has one,
§pushing), no Tailscale. There is a **browser** (`docs/notes.md`, fact 3), but no *gate* may need one.
**No `awk`** and **no `shellcheck`** on this machine — do not write a script or a gate that needs
either.

### Linear access

There are no Linear tools in the tool list. `list_issues` / `save_issue` / `save_comment` / `get_issue`
are reachable through the same HTTP MCP endpoint `scripts/import-linear.py` uses, so drive it from a
wrapper. Recreate `/tmp/lin.py` if it is gone (`/tmp` is ephemeral):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Thin CLI over the Linear MCP server, reusing scripts/import-linear.py plumbing.
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py issues            # id, title, status
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-48      # full issue JSON
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py comment PER-48 FILE
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py state PER-48 "In Progress"
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py states            # the team's states
#   python3 /tmp/lin.py call get_issue '{"id":"PER-48"}'
import importlib.util, json, sys
REPO = '/home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith'
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('imp', REPO + '/scripts/import-linear.py')
imp = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(imp)
PROJECT = 'Holosmith'
a = sys.argv[1:]
if a[0] == 'issues':
    for i in imp.call('list_issues', {'project': PROJECT, 'limit': 250})['issues']:
        print(i['id'], i['status'], i['title'][:70])
elif a[0] == 'issue':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call('get_issue', {'id': a[1]}), indent=2))
elif a[0] == 'comment':
    print(imp.call('save_comment', {'issueId': a[1], 'body': open(a[2]).read()})['id'])
elif a[0] == 'state':
    imp.call('save_issue', {'id': a[1], 'project': PROJECT, 'state': a[2]})
    print(imp.call('get_issue', {'id': a[1]})['status'])
elif a[0] == 'states':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call('list_issue_statuses', {'team': 'PER'}), indent=2))
elif a[0] == 'call':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call(a[1], json.loads(a[2])), indent=2))
```

Always run it with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `rm -rf scripts/__pycache__` afterwards, or you will
leave an untracked `scripts/__pycache__/` behind. `list_issues` on this project returns **80 issues**
(not 250); `grep -v ' Done '` is the quickest way to the unfinished ones.

**Two API traps, both hit already:**

- `save_issue` takes `state` (the **name**, e.g. `"In Progress"`). It rejects `stateId`.
- `get_issue` takes only `id`. Passing `project` is a validation error.

The team's states are `In Review`, `Backlog`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`, `Todo`, `In Progress`.
Never invent a state name.

**Token expiry is routine, not a blocker.** When a call prints `The Linear access token has expired.
Re-authenticate 'linear' in pi.`, refresh it in place — the store keeps a refresh token and a client id:

```python
import json, os, time, urllib.request, urllib.parse
p = os.path.expanduser('~/.pi/agent/mcp-auth.json'); key = 'mcp__linear|https://mcp.linear.app/mcp'
d = json.load(open(p)); e = d[key]
body = urllib.parse.urlencode({'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
                               'refresh_token': e['tokens']['refresh_token'],
                               'client_id': e['clientInformation']['client_id']}).encode()
req = urllib.request.Request(e['discovery']['authorizationServerMetadata']['token_endpoint'],
                            data=body, method='POST',
                            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})
new = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=60).read())
e['tokens'] = {**e['tokens'], **new}
e['tokensExpireAt'] = int((time.time() + int(new.get('expires_in', 3600))) * 1000)
json.dump(d, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
```

If that fails, **stop and report** — that is a `PROMPT.md` stop condition.

---

### Pushing

**Pushing works, through the sandbox's ssh-agent — but the sandbox's own `~/.ssh/config` gets in the
way.** `origin` is `git@github.com:AdamOlsson/holosmith.git`; `bwrap.sh` binds the host's
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at `/run/ssh-agent.sock` (the private key never enters the sandbox), so a push signs on
the host. The bound `~/.ssh/config` has a `Host github.com` block with `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github`, and
that file is **not** in the sandbox, so a plain `git push` fails with
`no such identity: /home/adamolsson/.ssh/github: No such file or directory` / `Permission denied
(publickey)`. It is intermittent — it worked once and failed the next commit — so use the override every
time:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' git push origin master
```

`-F /dev/null` is the load-bearing part: it stops ssh reading the sandbox's `~/.ssh/config` at all, which
is what names the missing key. (A plain `git push` worked once and then stopped; `-c
core.sshCommand='ssh -o IdentityAgent=…'` was not enough either — the config still won.) `ssh -T
git@github.com` with those options answering `Hi AdamOlsson!` is the way to check the agent before
blaming the remote.

**The reliable form offers ONE key.** The agent holds three, and *which* GitHub accepts changes between
sessions — in this session it was the **third**, offered by `sed -n '3p'`, after the first two were rejected
(`ls-remote` succeeded with it once and failed the next time, so retry the loop rather than trusting one
probe). Loop over the three, offer one at a time, and push as soon as one works:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do ssh-add -L | sed -n "${i}p" > /tmp/k.pub
  GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/k.pub \
    -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git" \
    git push origin master && break; done
```

(The older single-key form, for reference:)

```bash
ssh-add -L | sed -n '2p' > /tmp/pushkey.pub
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/pushkey.pub \
  -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' \
  git push origin master
```

(`-i` names a `.pub` that is in the agent: ssh offers exactly that one and signs with the agent's copy.)
`git ls-remote` with the same options is the cheap way to tell "pushed" from "the agent refused again".
Push after every commit that matters, and if a push fails, report it — do not fake one.

## 3. The gates

`. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh` first. Then:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test                          # lib + every test binary; the run prints the counts
cargo test --test schema_previous   # the `migrations` phase, run on its own
cd web && npm test                  # the transcript's rules, node's own runner
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit          # not a gate phase, but a web edit that does not typecheck is a bug
scripts/verify.sh                   # THE one-command gate since HS-006
```

`scripts/verify.sh` runs seven phases, cheapest first: `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, **`migrations`**
(`cargo test --test schema_previous` — the expand/contract rule, HS-075), `build` (`scripts/build.sh`, which
itself runs `build-web.sh` — `npm test` then Vite — and `check-static.sh` last), `embed`
(`scripts/check-embed.sh`), then `serve` — the **shipped musl artifact** booted on `--port 0` with a temp data
dir, running its cases plus a CORS sweep, then torn down with `SIGTERM` and an asserted exit 0. **The run
prints its own case and assertion counts — quote those, never a number copied out of this file.** It takes
~10 min (both musl targets, the Docker cases, `case_idle_stop`'s real minute and `case_preview`'s container). `--no-build` skips `build`
and `embed`; `--keep` keeps the work dir.

Some cases bring their own boot, and they are the ones a new story is most likely to collide with:

| Case | What it needs |
| --- | --- |
| `case_token_budget`, `case_usage_survives_resume`, `case_compaction`, `case_history`, `case_backup`, `case_worktree`, `case_worktree_refusal`, `case_agent_launch`, `case_docker_resume`, `case_docker_turn`, `case_internet_toggle` | its own `serve`, and (the last four) the daemon and `agent_image` |
| `case_docker_preflight` | no server at all |
| `case_container_mounts` | no server *and* no daemon — one printed `SKIP` line when there is neither a daemon nor an image |
| `case_exit_classification` | `python3` (it reads a row's `expected_stop` out of `app.db`), skips without it |
| `case_egress_proxy` | **no** server, daemon, internet or key: it starts the artifact as `proxy egress` on a loopback port and asks it four questions over a socket |
| `case_schema_newer` | no daemon; boots the artifact over a schema-99 database |
| `case_key_proxy_request` | a stand-in `openssl` on `PATH`; asserts the bytes the key proxy really sends |
| `case_preview` | **its own boot** (stub backend, own data root, `preview_listen = "127.0.0.1:0"`) and, for its second half, the daemon and `agent_image` — it makes its own `s_<id>` container on an `--internal` `agents_<id>` and prints one `SKIP` line without them; the first half always runs and puts the shared boot back |

A story is not done until the gates are green on a clean tree, and then you run the story's own demo
yourself and paste its output.

**Every story adds at least one `case_*`** — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md` and the reviewer enforces
it. Two shapes to avoid: a case that *needs* a session created two cases earlier, and a case whose `SKIP`
would also fire when the feature it checks is deleted (§6).

**Run one build at a time.** A `scripts/build.sh` or `scripts/verify.sh` in the same tree while another
one runs can make `check-static.sh`'s banner wait flake under load (it happened once during HS-013: the
gate reported `FAIL build/failed` while the same command passed a minute later, alone). Serialise them.

**Rebuild after committing.** `git describe` is baked into the artifact and `check-static.sh` fails on a
stale `dist/`, so a commit without a rebuild leaves the gate red. Commit, then `scripts/verify.sh`, then
the demo you paste.

**Rebuild after editing `web/`, before any demo.** The artifact embeds `web/dist`, so a demo run against
an artifact built before the page changed is a demo of the *old* page — and it will look like your fix
did nothing. HS-020 lost a demo cycle exactly this way: the fix to `main.ts` was invisible until
`scripts/build.sh` ran again. `scripts/verify.sh` rebuilds, so "gate green, then demo" is the safe order.

                            a step boundary when the row leaves `starting`; after the pi step it spawns the
                            task that awaits the backend's `ExitWatcher` and calls `Exits::record` (HS-031)
  src/turn.rs               the turn runner (HS-015) and the turn timeout (HS-022): touch → the
                            backend's turn → agent_settled + touch, abort_completed (or a `debug` line if
                            the ladder got there first), or unexpected_exit with the reason. Under a
                            deadline the ladder is *spawned* and the turn keeps being awaited;
                            `TURN_TIMEOUT`, `turn::timeout(minutes)`. `TurnEnd` is the backend's answer
  src/ladder.rs             the abort ladder (HS-016): clear_queue → abort → wait out abort_grace →
                            `running → stopped` with the caller's reason → stop. `climb` adds the
                            resume (the abort); `end_turn` returns `Ending::{Asked,Forced}` and does
                            not (the delete, the timeout and the budget). `FORCED_ABORT`
  src/sweeper.rs            the idle stop's task (HS-021): `Sweeper::sweep` (one pass, public for tests),
                            `run` (the tick loop), `spawn`; `IDLE_STOP`, `TICK` (5 s, a constant)
  src/stop.rs               the one way a container is stopped (HS-030): `Stopper { backend, database }`,
                            `stop` writes `sessions.expected_stop` and *then* calls the backend's `stop`.
                            The sweeper, the create's eviction and the ladder's forced rung all use it, so

                            stderr)` which takes the flag, applies `PiExit` or `UnexpectedExit`, and appends

                            and **publishes** the rest, stderr into a 64 KiB tail, the exit sent after the last

### What exists and what does not

- **Working:** `version` (text + `--json`), `config {validate,show,edit}`, `serve` (control listener,
  embedded app, `/api/health`, `POST`/`GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/{prompt,abort,steer,resume}`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}[?force=true]`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events`, `…/events/history`, `…/tool-output/{tool_id}`,
  `…/tool-image/{tool_id}/{index}`), SQLite with **four** migrations, the guards, the event writer (which
  coalesces a commit's deltas), the SSE stream, the stub backend and its four-step provisioner, the
  enforced state machine, the abort ladder, the delete flow, the cap with eviction, the create's and the
  resume's three project refusals, the compaction task (which folds a day-old message into one
  `message.snapshot`), the Sessions screen with its create form (which prints a project
  refusal's sentence alone) and the "nothing was deleted" notice, the session screen at
  `/sessions/<id>` with a live transcript and a four-action composer.
- **The agent is real (HS-031) and so is a turn (HS-032 – HS-034).** A Docker create provisions the worktree,
  the network, the attached container running pi in RPC mode, and pi's ready handshake, and ends **`idle`**;
  the agent's directory and the launch line are under the data root, the exit the attached stdio observes is
  classified, and a resume replaces the container and reaches `idle` again. A **prompt** reaches pi, its
  records become the transcript's frames, a tool call's output is filed, and the session's spend is counted —
  with one gap a real container still shows: pi refuses a `prompt` before a stream exists, because a session's
  network is `--internal`, its pi-home has only a dummy key, and the gate's machine stores no provider key, so
  `case_docker_turn` asserts pi's own refusal sentence and the streaming evidence is the committed fixtures —
  while HS-040's recorded run is the evidence that a real turn works end to end through the key proxy (text and
  thinking deltas, a tool round trip, usage), because the gate may not hold a provider key.
- **The egress proxy exists and is the only route out (HS-037).** `holosmith proxy egress` is a mode of the
  artifact; a Docker boot starts `hs_egress` on `egress` (bounded, `warn` on failure) and the network step
  joins it to a session's network under the alias `egress-proxy` **only when the row's `network` flag is set**,
  so `HTTPS_PROXY` is the same string either way and the difference is topology. HS-038 measured that (the boot's
  bare/joined pair and `case_internet_toggle`) and left the **copy** under the checkbox to whoever next owns the
  create form, because a new element is a UI change in a phase that forbids one (ADR-0046).
- **The migration rule has two halves and both are enforced (HS-075).** `schema::contract_violations` refuses an
  unmarked destructive statement in a migration (`cargo test`), and `tests/schema_previous.rs` refuses a drop or a
  rename against `docs/schema/previous.sql` — the gate calls the second the `migrations` **phase**. Refreshing
  that snapshot is a **release step** (`scripts/schema-snapshot.sh`), not a story's, and a contract migration
  changes it in the same commit. `schema::verdict` is the sentence `serve` warns with on a newer database and
  `doctor` will refuse with (ADR-0047).
- **What is left of the network half:** the delete's keep-rules (HS-043) — and with them the **delete affordance
  `web/` does not have** —, startup reconcile (HS-044), `doctor` (HS-045), and the phase-1 verification run
  (HS-046). The preview listener (HS-041) is done: the binary's third byte tunnel, `/‹host›/‹id›/*` with the
  prefix stripped and an upgrade's `Origin` checked, and **V7 passes** (the host reaches a container on an
  `--internal` network, measured directly and through the artifact). The key proxy (HS-039) and its
  **verification** (HS-040 — V3, V4 and V5 pass) and the WIP snapshot (HS-042) are done, and the spec's
  verification table has a **Result** column that HS-046 finishes filling.
- **The log is now read in two shapes and written by two producers of two kinds.** The stream replays a
  *window* (`history_window`, default 50) and says so with `history.truncated`; `GET …/events/history`
  answers the frames below that cursor. `events/stream.rs`'s `REPLAY_LIMIT` is still `u32::MAX` — it is
  "everything from the cut", and a second window there would be an invisible truncation. The project
  backup is a second *writer* of files under the data root (`<data>/backups/`), not of the database.
- **A stop is now recorded as the server's own, and a clean exit has its own state row — observed.**
  `Stopper` writes `expected_stop` before the `docker stop`, and `Exits::record` turns an exit into `stopped`
  (expected), `stopped · pi_exit` (code 0, no flag) or `error` + the last stderr lines. Since HS-031 its
  caller is the task the provisioner spawns after a successful pi step, fed by the backend's `ExitWatcher`
  (ADR-0039). Do not "fix" anything by adding a `docker events` watcher: the attached process *is* the
  observation.
- **Four policies can now stop something and they must not be confused:** the cap evicts (`evicted`,
  inside a create), the sweeper stops a quiet one (`idle_stop`, on its own tick), the turn timeout ends a
  *turn* (`turn_timeout`, from the runner) and the token budget ends a *turn* (`budget_exceeded`, also from
  the runner, on one `fired` shared with the timeout so only one climb happens). All of them go through
  `Transitioner::apply`, and the row moves before the container in every one of them.
- **`runtime::Backend`** has `Stub` and `Docker`; `serve --backend` and the config key `backend` select
  it. `DockerBackend::new(ContainerSettings)` provisions all four steps, runs a turn's five operations and
  implements the WIP snapshot. The default backend is **`docker`** (ADR-0001: the stub is opt-in), so a
  default build provisions a session to `error` with a reason rather than hanging in `starting`, and
  `scripts/verify.sh` boots with `backend = "stub"` in its config (so does `scripts/check-static.sh`'s
  empty-root run, because a Docker run refuses at startup on a machine that fails the preflight, HS-024, and
  that sandbox has no daemon, no `git` and no `df`). (Since HS-026 a create for a project that is not a plain
  checkout is refused earlier, with a 422; the demo trick HS-019 used still works for a project that *is*
  one — which is also how HS-019 provoked a real failed snapshot from the shipped artifact.)
- **`AppState`** is `{ config, runtime, database: Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Database>>, events: EventWriter,
  streams: StreamRegistry, backend: Backends }`, with **seven** wiring helpers — `provisioner()`,
  `turner()`, `transitioner()`, `ladder()`, `deleter()`, `sweeper()` (an `Option`, `None` when
  `idle_stop_min` is 0) and `compactor()` (always `Some`). The mutex is an explicit stopgap
  (ADR-0012/0013; `docs/notes.md`'s *Data and state* landmines).
- **`sessions::state::Transitioner::apply`** is the only way a session's state changes; `apply_logged`
  is the runners' wrapper (log, never return). A provisioning step report is `from == to` with `step`
  set and is *not* a table row.
- **The create is one lock scope plus a loop.** `create_locked` answers `Slot::{Inserted, Existing,
  Full}`; a `Full` makes `slot_for` evict one idle session (through `apply`, which takes the lock
  itself) and try again. Idempotency is checked first, so a retry never evicts anyone. `evict_one`
  moves the row **before** it spawns the backend's `stop`, because the row is what frees the slot.
- **`config`** has (`31` keys now) `agent_image` (default `agent-image:<binary version>`; this machine's
  demos and the gate set `pi-agent:local`), `container_cpus` (2), `container_memory_mb` (4096),
  `container_pids` (512) — all three **refuse `0`** — plus `abort_grace` (default `10s`, **used** by the ladder), `idle_stop_min`,
  `stopped_ttl_days`, `min_free_gb`, `turn_timeout_min`, `max_session_tokens` and the rest — check
  `config show` before adding a key. The delete flow and **compaction** have **no** config key of their
  own (the 24-hour window is a constant), and `max_live_sessions` (default 3, ≥ 1) is the cap.
- **`POST /resume`** takes the transition, then spawns the provisioner, and **touches `last_active_at`**
  (a resumed session must not be the eviction's first candidate — which is now a real policy, not a
  future one). The cap is checked **before** the transition, and the resume answers `409 cap_reached`
  rather than evicting (ADR-0022, ADR-0024). `SessionBackend::resume` has had a body since HS-029 and is how
  a `stopped` row comes back.

## 5. The cycle — one issue, then write the state back

Everything is **sequential: one writer at a time**, never two children editing files. Review children are
read-only and may run in parallel.

1. **Confirm the issue.** Read §1's slice, the Linear body (`python3 /tmp/lin.py issue <IDENT>`, §2) and the
   spec items. **Check the issue's title against the story you mean** — the Linear number is not derivable
   from the `HS-` number (HS-059 is `PER-91`, not `PER-93`; a session wrote `Closes PER-93` for it and had to
   record the correction in three places). Note `HEAD` — that SHA is the review's fixed point.
2. **Plan.** For an **L** story, give a fresh `delegate` child a grilling brief
   (`~/.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` + `domain-modeling`): it puts **one** round of questions to *you*
   via `contact_supervisor`, and you answer with `subagent_supervisor({action:"reply", …})`. For **S/M**
   (HS-043 is M), write the plan yourself — it is faster and the analysis is usually already done. Either
   way: state the environment facts, name the files to read, list the decisions already settled, and
   **pre-answer the obvious round-2 questions**. A planner may write only `GLOSSARY.md` and a new
   `docs/adr/*.md`.
3. **Record in Linear before any code exists**: `save_comment` with the plan shape, a decisions→precedent
   table, the acceptance restated as testable checks, the non-goals, the docs touched, the demo, and the
   follow-ups; then `state` the issue `In Progress` and re-read it to confirm.
4. **Implement.** Two proven patterns: **S/M in-session** (most stories since HS-016), or **M/L with a lot
   of new surface** handed to a fresh `worker` child with a *written* brief — the plan plus the "how", the
   ground rules (no commit, no Linear, no new dependency, `env.sh` first, don't edit `docs/stories/**`), the
   exact gate commands, and "budget discipline: keep the tree compiling; if you run long, stop green and
   report which steps remain". Twice a child found a genuine contradiction in the brief — verify its claims
   rather than trusting them.
5. **Verify yourself.** Never trust a child's pasted output: run the gates and the demo. This has caught
   something every time (a wrong count, a demo-revealed message bug, a panic path, an assertion that passed
   over an already-stopped row).
6. **Review** with a fresh `reviewer` child running `~/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, read-only,
   against `<fixed point>...HEAD` plus untracked files, spec axis sourced from the Linear body + story slice
   + spec items. `git add -A` first and write `git diff --cached <fp>` to
   `/tmp/holosmith/reviews/PER-75-diff.txt` so new files appear. **The reviewer has no shell and no write
   tool**: check its claims, and *you* save the review verbatim to `docs/review/PER-75.md`. **Commit before
   launching it** — a child reading a tree that moves under it stalls.
7. **Fix** in the same session (or with a fresh `worker`), triaging every finding as fixed or
   dismissed-with-citation; a "won't fix" without a citation is not acceptable. Re-run the gates. Append a
   `## Resolution` table to the review file and commit it with the fixes. If a claim cannot be dismissed,
   mutate the code and watch the guarding test go red before believing it.
8. **Ship**: focused conventional commits that name the issue, the last one ending `Closes <IDENT>` (§1's
   identifier). Commit messages are prose about *why*, not a restatement of the diff — look at the last few
   for tone. Rebuild after committing (§3). Then `save_comment` with what shipped, the gates, the verbatim
   demo output, the acceptance item by item and the follow-ups; set the issue `Done`; re-read it to confirm.
9. **Push**, with the sandbox's single-key loop (§2). If the push fails, report it — never fake one.
10. **Write the state back.** Rewrite §1 of this file for the next issue (§1.10's shape), refresh
    the counts, the ADR number, the last gate run's numbers and §9's row, then commit that with the message
    `Refresh the handoff after <IDENT>`. Set §1's replacement by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking (Linear priority →
    `HS-###` order → anything already `In Progress` → skip an issue whose `Blocked by` stories are not `Done`).
11. **Kill every child you started, then stop.** This is the last thing a session does, and it is not
    optional: a child still running holds the working tree, a port, a data root or a Docker network, and the
    next agent then finds a tree that moves under it, a port that is taken, or a `case_*` that fails for a
    reason that belongs to *your* session. Nothing may outlive the session that started it.
    - **Subagent children:** `subagent({action:"list"})` and `subagent({action:"stop", id})` on every run
      that is still live — the planner, every `worker`, every `reviewer`, and one you left `interrupted`. A
      run that already answered needs nothing; a run that is *listed as running* is the one that matters.
      `stop` is not resumable, which is exactly right at the end of a session: a half-finished brief is
      recoverable from Linear and `docs/review/`, a child that keeps editing the tree is not.
    - **Processes:** every demo's `serve`, every backgrounded `timeout` wrapper, `scripts/verify.sh` if you
      interrupted it, and any `node`/`python3` client you left running. **Score the pids when you start them
      and kill those pids** — `pgrep -f 'holosmith serve'` matches unrelated processes (a landmine, in
      `docs/notes.md`), so a pattern-based kill is both too broad and unreliable.
    - **Docker:** `docker rm -f` every container a demo or a test made (`s_*`, `hs_*` names of yours) and
      `docker network rm` the `agents_*` network it made; leave the machine's own `hs_egress`/`hs_key`
      alone if `serve` is not yours to stop, and never remove a container you did not create.
    - **Check it, do not assume it:** `subagent({action:"list"})` shows nothing running, the pids you scored
      are gone, `docker ps` shows none of your containers, and `git status --short` is clean apart from the
      operator's own `log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`. Then say in one line what you killed, and stop.

Working artifacts (`/tmp` is ephemeral; the durable record is Linear + `docs/review/` + `git log`):

## 6. Which notes bear on this issue

The catalogue lives in **`docs/notes.md`** — read the **cross-cutting** sections before you start anything,
then the sections below. It is a reference: everything there is a measurement or a review finding.

| Read | Why it bears on what a delete keeps |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-cutting: *Build and toolchain*, *Tests*, *HTTP and the envelope*, *Data and state*, *Web*, *Config and docs*, *Reviews*, *Demos* | True of every story. The **Web** and **Demos** sections are where this one is most likely to go wrong: the page has no delete affordance today, and a demo's trap must remove its container, not only its server. |
| *Landmines: worktrees (HS-025)* | The worktree is `‹projects›/.worktrees/‹id›`, its `.git` is a **file** pointing into the project's `.git/worktrees/‹id›`, `remove` is `worktree remove --force` then `branch -D` then `prune`, and teardown treats a missing worktree, branch or project as success — so a keep-rule must be expressed in *this* module or it will not be applied at all. |
| *Landmines: Docker — mounts, containers, starts* | A container is `s_<id>`, a network `agents_<id>`, and a teardown detaches the proxies before `network rm` — the delete's step order is what keeps that true. |
| *Landmines: the expected-stop flag and the exit classifier* | A delete stops a running session through the ladder and `Stopper`, and the exit it provokes must not be classified as an unexpected death (`docker rm -f` supersedes the launch first, ADR-0040). |
| *Landmines: project refusals and coalescing* | The row's removal is one transaction that also deletes its event log, and the writer **drops** an event whose session has gone — so a delete must not be read as "the log is authoritative about what happened". |
| *Landmines: the credential path* | The delete's first step is `key::Store::revoke`: a dummy key that spends money must stop working the moment the operator asked. |
| *Landmines: the preview listener* | Not this issue's subject, but its last bullet is the newest and the most expensive: a demo's trap owes Docker the container and the network, and a leftover `s_*` container made the *next* gate run fail two pi-launch tests. |

Three rules worth repeating here because they are the most expensive to relearn: **a test that cannot fail
is worse than no test** (mutate the behaviour and watch it go red); **a gate case that SKIPs on the bug it
exists to catch is this project's P1**; and **after any scripted Markdown edit, read the changed lines** —
three such edits have cost a review finding each.

## 7. Decisions taken on the operator's behalf (do not silently undo)

Almost every hard-to-reverse decision is an ADR (`docs/adr/0001` … `0050`, one line each in
`docs/stories/README.md`): read the recent ones before planning, and **amend rather than rewrite** — an ADR
a later story changes gets a "Superseded by ADR-00xx" note (0012/0013, and 0026 amended 0020).

The handful that are **not** in an ADR, and that a fresh session is most likely to undo by accident:

- the default branch stays **`master`** — this repo has no `main`, and renaming it would be an invented
  change;
- **never fake a push**: report the failure instead (§2's loop is how a push actually works);
- **`docs/stories/**` is not edited** — it is the source the Linear issues were imported from; a contract
  that needs changing goes in an ADR;
- the default backend is **`docker`** with the stub opt-in (ADR-0001), so every test and script that boots
  `serve` says which backend it means;
- **S/M stories are implemented in-session; M/L ones go to a worker child with a written brief** (§5);
- the **Linear issue number is not derivable from the story number** — read the title before writing
  `Closes <IDENT>`;
- **one issue per session, then write the state back and stop** (this file's own rule, §5 steps 10–11);
- **nothing a session starts outlives it** — every subagent run, every demo server and every container it
  made is stopped before it stops (§5, step 11). A leftover child is not harmless: it keeps editing a tree
  the next agent has to trust.

## 8. Resume checklist

```bash
cd /home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith
git status --short                                  # clean apart from log.txt/orchestrate.sh
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh                           # ALWAYS before cargo/rustc
python3 /tmp/lin.py issues | grep -v ' Done ' | head # recreate /tmp/lin.py first (§2)
python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-75                    # scoped, Backlog, the issue §1 names
docker version                                      # the daemon must answer, or V7 cannot be measured
docker image inspect pi-agent:local                 # the image the Docker stories run
scripts/verify.sh                                   # baseline green, ~9–12 min (it prints its own counts)
```

If the baseline is red before you touch anything, that is the first thing you fix — and say so in Linear.

Then start §5 on **§1's issue** (`PER-75`, HS-043) and stop after step 11.

Before you begin, check that the last session left nothing behind — `subagent({action:"list"})` should show
no run in progress, `docker ps` none of its containers, and `git status --short` should look like the line
above. If it does not, that is the first thing you fix, and say so in Linear: a tree another session is still
editing is a stop-the-line error, not an inconvenience.

## 9. Reporting

The durable record is **Linear** (plan, demo output and ship note per issue), **`docs/review/PER-<n>.md`**
(the review verbatim and its `## Resolution` table) and **`git log`**. Keep a short ledger in the
conversation while the session runs (issue → plan → implement → review → fix → ship) so a restart can see it
from those three; do not carry old sessions' ledgers in this file.

If you stop before the issue ships, say so explicitly, name the next action, and leave the tree clean and the
gates green — **a half-finished story is worse than an honest stop**.

**The last shipped story** (`PER-73`, HS-041, ADR-0051; commits `432c281`, `23eeed4`, `c0c18b6`, `151d8a6`,
`8e71786`, `ae80439`): the preview listener is the binary's **third byte tunnel** —
`src/preview.rs` + a `src/tunnel.rs` extracted from `egress.rs` — serving only `/<host>/<id>/*`, stripping the
prefix, relaying bodies and upgrades transparently, refusing an upgrade whose `Origin` is missing or foreign
(403), an unknown host or id (404) and a container that is not there (502), and answering the unslashed root with
a 308 so a page's relative URLs resolve. `preview_upstream_port` is a new config key (31 → 32) and
`HS_PREVIEW_PORT` tells the container which port to serve on; `preview_origin` is `GET /api/health`'s fifth key
and the session screen links to `/local/<id>/` on it. **V7 passes** and is recorded in the spec's table; the
spec's fallback is deliberately not built. Review *OK with notes*: 7 standards + 3 spec findings, no P1, nine fixed
and one dismissed with a citation. Demo: the host fetching a container's dev server directly, through the listener,
from a second host address, a WebSocket round trip, a foreign-origin refusal and the shipped page's link bytes.
Its full record is Linear, `docs/review/PER-73.md` and `git log`; do not carry it forward.

**One thing this build does not do, recorded rather than discovered:** a resumed session's pi has **no
memory** of earlier turns (`--no-session`; the transcript is Holosmith's log). Replaying the log into a new pi
is a product decision with a token cost and needs its own story — ADR-0040 and ADR-0039 both say so, and
nothing in the backlog owns it yet.
