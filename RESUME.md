# RESUME — one issue per session (next: PER-86 / HS-054, the merge's fast-forward path)

You are the **orchestrator for implementing Holosmith**. `PROMPT.md` is the standing operating procedure and
still governs the cycle; this file is the state of the world, and it adds one rule of its own:

**This session picks up exactly one issue — the one named in §1.** Take it through the whole cycle (§5):
plan, Linear, implement, gates, demo, review, fix, ship, **write the state back** into this file for the next
agent (§5, step 10), then **kill every child you started** and stop (§5, step 11). Do not start a second issue
however much budget is left: a fresh session with a fresh file is how this run continues, and one honest stop
beats two half-finished stories.

The operator is not present. **Never ask a question.** Decide canonically — `HolosmithSpec.md` →
`GLOSSARY.md` → `docs/adr/` → `docs/stories/` → the existing code — record the decision in the Linear issue
and the commit message, and continue.

Read in this order, and no further: **this file**; the issue's slice in `docs/stories/`; the spec items §1
names (and the V-rows); the ADR index (one line per decision, `docs/stories/README.md`), then only the ADRs
§1 names; then `docs/notes.md` — the **cross-cutting** section first, then the sections §6 of *this* file
names for this issue. `docs/notes.md` is the durable prose record (the build's shape, the event contract, the
landmines). Anything about a *finished* story is in Linear, `docs/review/PER-<n>.md` and `git log` — not here.

## 0. What this project is

`HolosmithSpec.md` is authoritative. A single-operator system that runs coding agents in containers on
machines you own, driven from a phone. The work is **80 stories** (`HS-001` … `HS-080`) in `docs/stories/`,
one Linear issue each, in five phases:

| Phase | Stories | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — walking skeleton | HS-001 … HS-006 | `docs/stories/phase-0-walking-skeleton.md` |
| 1 — session lifecycle (stub backend) | HS-007 … HS-023 | `docs/stories/phase-1-session-lifecycle-stub.md` |
| 1b — Docker backend | HS-024 … HS-046 | `docs/stories/phase-1b-docker-backend.md` |
| 2 — deployable MVP | HS-047 … HS-067 | `docs/stories/phase-2-deployable-mvp.md` |
| 3 — multiple machines | HS-068 … HS-074 | `docs/stories/phase-3-multiple-machines.md` |
| 4 — self-development | HS-075 … HS-080 | `docs/stories/phase-4-self-development.md` |

`AGENTS.md` carries the repository rules, including that **Linear scope is exactly one project**: `Holosmith`
(`P-PER-2`, team `Personal`/`PER`). `VulkanRenderAPI` belongs to another repository — never read, create,
comment on, or close anything there.

**Branch `master`** (this repo has **no `main`**; do not rename it). Every commit is pushed; pushing is a
sandbox-specific incantation (§2).

---

## 1. The issue this session picks up: `PER-86` — HS-054, the merge's fast-forward path

**State when this file was written** (`origin/master` at `0eae606`, the tree clean apart from the operator's own
`log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`): **58 of 80 stories Done, 22 Backlog**, all in project `Holosmith`. `PER-86` is
`Backlog`, it is the next in `HS-###` order, and its one blocker (`HS-052`) is `Done` — so it is eligible.
`PER-87`…`PER-90` (HS-055…HS-058) are blocked by it.

The last shipped story was `PER-85` (HS-053, the changes view's unified diff, **ADR-0062**) — the eighth of phase
2's twenty-one. Its gate run was green: **79 cases, 1174 assertions**, no `SKIP`; `cargo test` is **981 tests across
51 targets**, and `web/`'s runner is **52**. Its §1 material is now Linear, `docs/review/PER-85.md`, `git log` and
§9.

### 1.1 The slice (verbatim from `docs/stories/phase-2-deployable-mvp.md`; Linear's body is the same text)

> ### HS-054 — Merge: fast-forward path
>
> **As** the operator **I want** to merge a finished session with one tap **so that** work actually lands.
>
> - **Size:** M · **Blocked by:** HS-052 · **Spec:** item 12 (rules 2, 4)
> - **Demo:** merge a session whose branch is ahead of the target; the target advances and the response names the
>   new commit.
>
> **Acceptance**
> - [ ] `POST /api/sessions/:id/merge` with `{target, strategy, message?, delete_session?}`; `strategy` defaults to
>   `ff-only`.
> - [ ] `target` must be a local branch listed in `merge.targets` (default `main` and `master`, whichever exist);
>   otherwise 422.
> - [ ] `ff-only` fast-forwards directly without a temporary worktree and fails with 409 `not_fast_forward` if the
>   target moved.
> - [ ] If the target is not checked out anywhere, update it with `git update-ref refs/heads/<target> <new> <old>`
>   (compare-and-swap).
> - [ ] If the target is checked out in the main checkout, run `git merge --ff-only <new>` there; local changes that
>   would be overwritten → 409 `target_dirty`.
> - [ ] Returns `{merged_commit, target, strategy}`.

`docs/stories/**` is **not edited** (§7). An **M** story: the first route in this build that **writes to the
project repository** — everything before it only read.

### 1.2 The spec it closes

Item 12's rules **2 and 4**, in full:

> **Rule 2.** One merge per project at a time. The server creates a temporary detached worktree at
> `<data>/merge/<id>` from the target, runs the merge there with `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` so that your hooks
> never run agent-written code, and removes the worktree afterwards. `ff-only` skips the temporary worktree and
> fast-forwards directly, failing with 409 `not_fast_forward` if the target has moved.

And, separately, the rule that says what "updating the target" means in the two checkout shapes:

> **Rule 4.** Updating the target: if it is not checked out anywhere, `git update-ref refs/heads/<target> <new>
> <old>` (compare-and-swap). If it is checked out in the main checkout, `git merge --ff-only <new>` runs there,
> which updates the working tree safely and fails with 409 `target_dirty` if your local changes would be
> overwritten.

And the item's governing sentence: "all git work for review and merge runs on the host in the project repository;
containers never merge". Rule 2's temporary worktree, `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, the conflict arm (rule 3), the
guards (rule 1) and `delete_session` (rule 5) are **not** this story: HS-055 owns `merge`/`squash` and the temp
worktree, HS-056 owns the guards and `delete_session`, HS-057 is publish, HS-058 the Changes sheet.

### 1.3 What already exists

- **`changes.rs` reads the same repository and answers every question this story needs to ask before it writes.**
  `basis(&Worktree)` (private, both readers' ordered refusals: `NoRepository` → `Missing` → `Unregistered` →
  `NoBranch`, then `Git`), `Changes::read` with `head` (`Worktree::branch_head`), `target` (`first_target`, the
  first **existing** branch of `config.merge.targets`), `dirty` (`status --porcelain --untracked-files=normal
  --no-optional-locks`, the same definition of work the WIP snapshot and the delete use), `files`, and
  `merge_trial` (`merge-tree --write-tree` → `Merge::{Clean, Conflicted, Unasked}`). `changes::diff` (HS-053) is
  the second reader, and both share `basis`.
- **`worktree.rs` is the host-git seam**: `Worktree::of` (the naming rule: `agent/<id>`, `.worktrees/<id>`),
  `Worktree::branch_head`, `ahead` (`rev-list --count`), `registrations` (git's own `worktree list --porcelain`,
  HS-044 — **the reader that answers "is the target checked out anywhere"**), `Retained`/`retained` (the delete's
  keep-rule), and the four git-runner functions `git_output`/`git_error`/`git_error_from`/`git_command`
  (`pub(crate)`, the only `Command::new("git")` in `src/`).
- **The handler template for a session route that writes**: `http/sessions.rs` (`prompt`, `steer`, `delete`) —
  the guards come from the route table, the body is taken as `Result<Bytes, BytesRejection>` so a rejection becomes
  ADR-0008's `bad_body`, the row is read under one lock, and a state change goes through
  `Transitioner::apply`. `http/changes.rs` is the read-only sibling with the same scope discipline.
- **The codes that already exist**: `SESSION_RUNNING`, `UNSAVED_WORK` (the delete's "could not snapshot"),
  `NO_WORKTREE`, `BAD_BODY`, `UNKNOWN_FIELD`, `BAD_PROJECT`, `INTERNAL`. There is **no** `not_fast_forward`, no
  `target_dirty`, no `conflict`.
- **`config.merge.targets`** exists (default `["main", "master"]`, HS-043) and `Changes.target` already resolves
  "the first existing" — the merge must accept the same list and no other.
- **The delete flow** (`deleter.rs`, `DELETED`, `apply_trigger`) and the WIP snapshot (`snapshot::take`,
  `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>`) exist for HS-056; this story only has to *not* touch a row.
- **The gate**: `case_changes` and `case_changes_diff` boot a real repository with no daemon
  (`backend = "docker"` against a `_ping`-only socket, the worktree re-made by the step's own command).
  `tests/changes.rs`'s `Fixture` is a real repo in a `TempDir` plus a served router.

### 1.4 What does not exist

No `/merge` route, no merge function, no request/response type, no `not_fast_forward` or `target_dirty` code, no
per-project serialisation ("one merge per project at a time" has no lock to take — `DockerBackend`'s start lock is
per *session* and belongs to the backend), no reader that answers "which checkout has `<target>`", no
`case_merge`, and no `tests/merge.rs`.

### 1.5 The decisions that shape the design

1. **Where the write lives.** `changes.rs` is the host-git module and already owns `basis`, the changed-file list
   and `merge-tree`'s trial; a `merge.rs` beside it would either duplicate `basis` or import it and be a second
   home for the same refusals. Say in the ADR which you chose and why — the honest argument for a new file is that
   the changes view is a **reader** and a merge writes refs, so the module doc's "no write" promise would have to
   change; the honest argument against is that "what is this session's diff base" and "what may I merge into" are
   the same two facts.
2. **The request body and the two fields this story cannot honour.** `strategy` may be `merge` or `squash`
   (HS-055) and `delete_session: true` deletes the row (HS-056). Recommend: parse all four keys (an unknown one is
   `422 unknown_field`, as the create does), default `strategy` to `ff-only`, and answer a **`422`** with a
   sentence for the two values this story cannot honour — refusing loudly beats ignoring a request that says
   "delete the session". Record it, and make the acceptance's "`strategy` defaults to `ff-only`" a wire test.
3. **Which target may be merged into.** The acceptance says "a local branch listed in `merge.targets`", so there
   are two conditions and two ways to fail: a name not in the config list, and a name in the config list that the
   repository does not have. Both are `422` (the parameter is wrong), and `Changes::read`'s `first_target` is the
   precedent for "a name the repository does not have is not a target".
4. **The fast-forward test.** `ff-only` must refuse when the target has moved: `git merge-base --is-ancestor
   refs/heads/<target> refs/heads/agent/<id>` (exit 1 = not an ancestor → `409 not_fast_forward`), or the
   compare-and-swap's own failure. Decide which is the *primary* check and what each exit code means; the CAS is
   the race-free one and the ancestry test is the readable one, and a target that moved *between* the two is
   exactly the case the CAS exists for.
5. **Where the target is checked out, and how.** `worktree::registrations` reads `git worktree list --porcelain`,
   which prints `worktree <path>` / `branch refs/heads/<name>` pairs: that is the measurement, and the project's
   own checkout is the one whose path **is** the repository. A session's worktree could in principle hold the
   target; decide what that means (probably: treat it like any other checkout and refuse `409` rather than write a
   working tree under a container's feet — or don't, and say so).
6. **`git merge --ff-only` in a checkout, and `409 target_dirty` without parsing English.** Git's own refusal
   text is not a contract and this build never parses another program's English (ADR-0028's lesson, `doctor`'s
   three-armed facts). Decide between: pre-checking `status --porcelain` in that checkout and refusing if dirty
   (coarse — an unrelated dirty file is not "would be overwritten"), or running the merge and, **when git exits
   non-zero**, reading `status --porcelain` to choose `409 target_dirty` vs `500`. The second is honest and the
   code is chosen by our own measurement; record which, and what the sentence says.
7. **The response is three keys** — `{merged_commit, target, strategy}` — and the spec does not say what else may
   travel. HS-056's `kept` and the delete's additive key are the precedent for an additive key if you need one
   (the old target commit? the path the merge ran in?). Say why if you add one.
8. **Nothing about the row changes.** A merge is not a state transition and not an event (HS-056's guards may
   make it one). Say so in the ADR: the session stays whatever it was, the branch is merged, and `GET …/changes`
   then answers `ahead: 0` because that is a measurement of the branch.
9. **One merge per project at a time.** A `tokio`/`std` mutex keyed by project, held for the whole write. Decide
   where it lives (`AppState` beside `database`, or a `Merges` type in the new module), and whether it is taken
   inside the `spawn_blocking` (a `std` mutex is honest there, since the whole write is synchronous).
10. **Host, `spawn_blocking`, never a container.** Item 12's sentence again. The handler knows no backend — and
    unlike HS-052's reads, a merge is a **write**, so say in the ADR what a second merge of the same session
    answers (idempotent? `not_fast_forward`? `ahead: 0` already) and why.
11. **Hooks never run.** Rule 2's `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` is written for the temp-worktree path (HS-055), but
    `git merge --ff-only` in a checkout can also run hooks (`post-merge`). Decide whether it is passed here too —
    item 12's sentence is "so that your hooks never run agent-written code", and a `post-merge` hook in a project
    repository is a program the host runs. Recommend: pass it, and say so; if you decide against, say what a
    `post-merge` hook can do that a `merge --ff-only` cannot avoid.
12. **The refusal family is the changes view's.** `basis` answers the four `409 no_worktree` facts and `500`s
    git's failures; a merge inherits them (there is no branch to merge, or no worktree, or a repository gone).
    Reuse the sentences — a client that learned `GET …/changes` learned the merge's refusals.

### 1.6 The questions the plan must answer (before code)

1. The exact request/response for: a clean ff merge into a **checked-out** target, the same into a **target no
   worktree has checked out**, a branch behind the target (`not_fast_forward`), a checkout with local changes
   (`target_dirty`), a target that is not in `merge.targets` (422), a branch name in the list the repository lacks
   (422), `strategy: "squash"` (422), `delete_session: true` (422), a session with no worktree (409 `no_worktree`),
   and two merges of one project at the same moment.
2. **Which git commands and flags**, and what each returns for the two update paths; and what `git merge --ff-only`
   prints and exits with when the target is checked out and clean, when it is dirty, and when the branch is not a
   descendant.
3. The refusal table: status, code and sentence per condition, and which of them are the changes view's.
4. Where the per-project lock lives, and what a second concurrent merge observes.
5. Which `case_*` proves each acceptance bullet, and which half can `SKIP` without skipping on its own subject.

### 1.7 Acceptance, restated as checks

- *The route and its body* — `POST /api/sessions/{id}/merge` with `{target:"main"}` answers `200` and
  `{merged_commit, target, strategy}`; the same body with `"strategy":"merge"` and with `"delete_session":true`
  answers `422` with its own code and sentence; a `strategy` absent means `ff-only` in the response.
- *The target rule* — `{"target":"nope"}` (not in the config) and `{"target":"trunk"}` (in the list, not in the
  repository) are both `422`, and no ref moved (`git rev-parse refs/heads/main` before and after).
- *The fast-forward* — a session branch one commit ahead: `refs/heads/main` **and its checkout's working tree** end
  at the branch's tip, and the response's `merged_commit` is that commit; a branch behind the target is
  `409 not_fast_forward` and nothing moves.
- *The two update paths* — measured separately: a bare/linked case where no worktree holds `main` (the ref moves,
  and `git rev-parse main` says so while the project's checkout still has the old file), and the normal case where
  the project's own checkout holds `main` (the file on disk changes too).
- *`target_dirty`* — a checkout holding an untracked-or-modified file the fast-forward would overwrite answers
  `409 target_dirty` and moves nothing.
- *Plus* the usual gates, one new `case_*`, and `docs/build.md`/`docs/notes.md`/`GLOSSARY.md`/an ADR (**0063**).

### 1.8 Non-goals

`merge`/`squash` strategies and the temporary merge worktree (HS-055), the conflict arm and `delete_session`
(HS-056), publish (HS-057), the Changes sheet (HS-058), rule 1's guards as *policy* (a running session may still
be merged by this story — HS-056 owns the refusal; say so if you implement it early), the hub, and any change to
`worktree.rs`'s create refusals.

### 1.9 The demo

On this machine: the `case_changes` boot (a real repository under a temp projects root, `backend = "docker"`
against a `_ping`-only socket) with a session branch two commits ahead and `main` checked out in the project's own
checkout; `POST /api/sessions/{id}/merge` with `{target:"main"}`; print the response (the new commit), `git log
--oneline -1 main` and `git log --oneline -1 agent/<id>` on the host at the same commit, the file the agent wrote
now present in the main checkout, and then, on the same repository, the **unchecked-out** path (a second project
whose `main` no worktree holds — `git rev-parse main` moves, the checkout's file does not), a `not_fast_forward`
(target has a commit the branch lacks, nothing moves), a `target_dirty` (a conflicting local edit), and the two
`422`s. **Say plainly what was not measured**: no container, no `merge`/`squash` strategy (HS-055), no
`delete_session` (HS-056), no UI.

### 1.10 What the next agent needs back

When you write the state back (§5, step 10): §1 becomes the **next** issue — by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking that is
`PER-87` (HS-055, the `merge` and `squash` strategies) *if* HS-054 ships, and `PER-86` again if it does not — with
the same shape. Refresh the counts, the ADR number you took (**ADR-0063** is next unless HS-054 takes none), the
last gate run's own numbers, and replace §9's row with this story's (short — one paragraph). Anything you learned
that is **not** state and **not** an ADR goes into `docs/notes.md` under a new `### Landmines: …` heading, never
into §1. Then kill what you started (§5, step 11).

## 2. Environment (already repaired — do not redo)

Everything below lives **outside the repo** and survives. If this is a fresh container, redo it exactly
as written.

```bash
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh      # ALWAYS source this before cargo/rustc
```

It sets `RUSTUP_HOME`, `CARGO_HOME` and `PATH` to:

- rustup 1.99.1, minimal profile + clippy/rustfmt, targets `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`;
- musl.cc cross toolchains for both arches (`x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`, `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/cc` → `/usr/bin/gcc` (the `cc` crate needs a `cc` on PATH);
- `~/.pi/toolchains/bin/qemu-aarch64-static` (7.2.0) — an **optional dev tool** so the aarch64 artifact
  can actually be *run* here. No repo script may download it; `scripts/check-static.sh` prints one
  `SKIP` line when it is absent and still passes.

Why outside the repo: `/` is a 3.4 GB tmpfs and `~/.pi` is the only large writable ext4 mount.

**Available:** node 24.22.2 / npm 11.19.1 with the npm registry reachable (node 24 strips TypeScript
types natively, which is what `npm test` relies on); `curl`; `python3` (with stdlib `sqlite3` and
`http.client`); `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, `cmp`, `find`, `timeout`, `git`; **Playwright's Chromium**
(`~/.cache/ms-playwright`, bound read-only by `bwrap.sh`) and the `playwright` npm package at
`~/.cache/hs-browser/pw/node_modules`. Two quirks, both hit: ESM **ignores `NODE_PATH`**, so a script
imports the package by its own path — `…/playwright/index.mjs` (the `.js` entry is CJS and its default
export does not have `chromium` at the top level); and Chromium must be launched with
`--no-sandbox`, because its own namespace sandbox cannot nest inside ours. A third, learned in HS-020:
**`networkidle` never settles** on the sessions list, because a live row holds an `EventSource` open —
navigate with `domcontentloaded` and wait for the rows.
**Available since HS-024: a real Docker daemon.** `docker version` shows a 29.9.2 server, `/var/run/docker.sock` exists,
`docker run` works and images pull over the network. `bwrap.sh` binds the host's socket at
`/var/run/docker.sock` (`DOCKER=()` … `--bind "$sock" /var/run/docker.sock`), so a `docker` inside the
sandbox drives the real daemon — that is host root by another name and it is granted deliberately; a
machine without a socket simply gets no binds. **`pi-agent:local` is loaded and is the image every Docker
story uses**: its pi version equals `pins/pi.txt` exactly (`agent::version_check` asserts it at launch), git
2.39.5, node 24, default user `node` (uid **1000**, the host uid). Everything the Docker chain needs is here,
including network access for `alpine:3` and friends. **A preview demo needs `node` inside the container** —
this image has it, and so must any image `agent_image` points at (HS-036 learned that the hard way: a missing
node is exit 127, not a test failure). **A `serve` boot starts `hs_egress` and `hs_key` and they outlive
it**, so a gate run or a demo leaves both running: remove them (`docker rm -f hs_egress hs_key`) when you want
`tests/container.rs`'s egress-proxy test to run its *real* path, which it skips while a proxy is running. Since
HS-048 both proxies run `holosmith-proxy:<version>`, built by `server deploy`'s step 3, so a boot on a machine
that has never deployed warns once and starts no proxy — and the gate's `case_server_images` is what leaves that
image behind for every later case.
The machine's own `egress` network must exist for that test (`docker network create egress` is the call a boot
makes) — a cleanup removed it once and the test failed on setup at HS-043's baseline.

**pi's own RPC documentation is on this machine**:
`~/.pi/agent/install/releases/1.5.0/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` (how to start
it, the JSONL framing rules — one complete JSON object per line, split on LF only, never a reader that also
splits on U+2028), `rpc-commands.md` (the `prompt`/`steer`/`abort`/`get_state` commands and the `disposition`
field), `json.md` (the event stream: `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, tool and message events),
`rpc-extension-ui.md` (the UI requests `pump` auto-cancels) and `environment-variables.md`. The binary in
the image is `/usr/local/bin/pi`, its version already equals `pins/pi.txt`, and `pi --mode rpc --no-session`
is the launch `agent::COMMAND` builds. `pi --help` in the sandbox is the same version's, so an experiment
is free; nothing in the repo may hard-code the path to those documents.

**Not available, and not to be invented:** no `sudo`, no `apt`, no `gh`, no ssh key (the agent has one,
§pushing), **no systemd** (`/proc/1/comm` is `bwrap`; `/run/systemd/system` does not exist) and **no Tailscale
daemon** — the `tailscale` CLI *is* at `/usr/bin/tailscale`, but `tailscale status` answers
`failed to connect to local tailscaled`, which is the fact `doctor` renders as `unknown` rather than failing on.
There is a **browser** (`docs/notes.md`, fact 3), but no *gate* may need one.
**No `awk`** and **no `shellcheck`** on this machine — do not write a script or a gate that needs
either.

### Linear access

There are no Linear tools in the tool list. `list_issues` / `save_issue` / `save_comment` / `get_issue`
are reachable through the same HTTP MCP endpoint `scripts/import-linear.py` uses, so drive it from a
wrapper. Recreate `/tmp/lin.py` if it is gone (`/tmp` is ephemeral):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Thin CLI over the Linear MCP server, reusing scripts/import-linear.py plumbing.

    imp.call('save_issue', {'id': a[1], 'project': PROJECT, 'state': a[2]})
    print(imp.call('get_issue', {'id': a[1]})['status'])
elif a[0] == 'states':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call('list_issue_statuses', {'team': 'PER'}), indent=2))
elif a[0] == 'call':
    print(json.dumps(imp.call(a[1], json.loads(a[2])), indent=2))
```

Always run it with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `rm -rf scripts/__pycache__` afterwards, or you will
leave an untracked `scripts/__pycache__/` behind. `list_issues` on this project returns **80 issues**
(not 250); `grep -v ' Done '` is the quickest way to the unfinished ones.

**Two API traps, both hit already:**

- `save_issue` takes `state` (the **name**, e.g. `"In Progress"`). It rejects `stateId`.
- `get_issue` takes only `id`. Passing `project` is a validation error.

The team's states are `In Review`, `Backlog`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`, `Todo`, `In Progress`.
Never invent a state name.

**Token expiry is routine, not a blocker.** When a call prints `The Linear access token has expired.
Re-authenticate 'linear' in pi.`, refresh it in place — the store keeps a refresh token and a client id:

```python
import json, os, time, urllib.request, urllib.parse
p = os.path.expanduser('~/.pi/agent/mcp-auth.json'); key = 'mcp__linear|https://mcp.linear.app/mcp'
d = json.load(open(p)); e = d[key]
body = urllib.parse.urlencode({'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
                               'refresh_token': e['tokens']['refresh_token'],
                               'client_id': e['clientInformation']['client_id']}).encode()
req = urllib.request.Request(e['discovery']['authorizationServerMetadata']['token_endpoint'],
                            data=body, method='POST',
                            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})
new = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=60).read())
e['tokens'] = {**e['tokens'], **new}
e['tokensExpireAt'] = int((time.time() + int(new.get('expires_in', 3600))) * 1000)
json.dump(d, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
```

If that fails, **stop and report** — that is a `PROMPT.md` stop condition.

### Pushing

**Pushing works, through the sandbox's ssh-agent — but the sandbox's own `~/.ssh/config` gets in the
way.** `origin` is `git@github.com:AdamOlsson/holosmith.git`; `bwrap.sh` binds the host's
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at `/run/ssh-agent.sock` (the private key never enters the sandbox), so a push signs on
the host. The bound `~/.ssh/config` has a `Host github.com` block with `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github`, and
that file is **not** in the sandbox, so a plain `git push` fails with
`no such identity: /home/adamolsson/.ssh/github: No such file or directory` / `Permission denied
(publickey)`. It is intermittent — it worked once and failed the next commit — so use the override every
time:

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' git push origin master
```

`-F /dev/null` is the load-bearing part: it stops ssh reading the sandbox's `~/.ssh/config` at all, which
is what names the missing key. (A plain `git push` worked once and then stopped; `-c
core.sshCommand='ssh -o IdentityAgent=…'` was not enough either — the config still won.) `ssh -T
git@github.com` with those options answering `Hi AdamOlsson!` is the way to check the agent before
blaming the remote.

**The reliable form offers ONE key.** The agent holds three, and *which* GitHub accepts changes between
sessions — in this session it was the **third**, offered by `sed -n '3p'`, after the first two were rejected
(`ls-remote` succeeded with it once and failed the next time, so retry the loop rather than trusting one
probe). Loop over the three, offer one at a time, and push as soon as one works:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do ssh-add -L | sed -n "${i}p" > /tmp/k.pub
  GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/k.pub \
    -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git" \
    git push origin master && break; done
```

(The older single-key form, for reference:)

```bash
ssh-add -L | sed -n '2p' > /tmp/pushkey.pub
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -F /dev/null -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/tmp/pushkey.pub \
  -o IdentityAgent=/run/ssh-agent.sock -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o User=git' \
  git push origin master
```

(`-i` names a `.pub` that is in the agent: ssh offers exactly that one and signs with the agent's copy.)
`git ls-remote` with the same options is the cheap way to tell "pushed" from "the agent refused again".
Push after every commit that matters, and if a push fails, report it — do not fake one.

## 3. The gates

`. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh` first. Then:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test                          # lib + every test binary; the run prints the counts
cargo test --test schema_previous   # the `migrations` phase, run on its own
cd web && npm test                  # the transcript's rules, node's own runner
cd web && npx tsc --noEmit          # not a gate phase, but a web edit that does not typecheck is a bug
scripts/verify.sh                   # THE one-command gate since HS-006
```

`scripts/verify.sh` runs seven phases, cheapest first: `fmt`, `clippy`, `test`, **`migrations`**
(`cargo test --test schema_previous` — the expand/contract rule, HS-075), `build` (`scripts/build.sh`, which
itself runs `build-web.sh` — `npm test` then Vite — and `check-static.sh` last), `embed`
(`scripts/check-embed.sh`), then `serve` — the **shipped musl artifact** booted on `--port 0` with a temp data
dir, running its cases plus a CORS sweep, then torn down with `SIGTERM` and an asserted exit 0. **The run
prints its own case and assertion counts — quote those, never a number copied out of this file.** Since HS-046
it also prints one `ok <case>` line per case that measured something: a case that printed `SKIP` withholds that
line and the run ends with `SKIP n of N cases measured nothing`, so `grep -c '^ok case_'` is the number that
proved something and a skip can never read as a pass. It takes
~11–12 min (both musl targets, the Docker cases, `case_idle_stop`'s real minute, `case_preview`'s container
and `case_doctor_full`'s self-test). `--no-build` skips `build`
and `embed`; `--keep` keeps the work dir.

Some cases bring their own boot, and they are the ones a new story is most likely to collide with:

| Case | What it needs |
| --- | --- |
| `case_token_budget`, `case_usage_survives_resume`, `case_compaction`, `case_history`, `case_backup`, `case_worktree`, `case_worktree_refusal`, `case_agent_launch`, `case_docker_resume`, `case_docker_turn`, `case_internet_toggle`, `case_doctor_full` | its own `serve`, and (the last five) the daemon and `agent_image` |
| `case_verification_table` | no server, no daemon, no image: it reads `HolosmithSpec.md`'s eleven `V<n>` rows (and runs first in `serve_cases`, so a rotted table fails before the Docker cases) |
| `case_docker_preflight`, `case_doctor_quick` | no server at all (`case_doctor_quick` builds its own `_ping` socket and picks its ports, so it needs `python3` and nothing else) |
| `case_container_mounts` | no server *and* no daemon — one printed `SKIP` line when there is neither a daemon nor an image |
| `case_exit_classification` | `python3` (it reads a row's `expected_stop` out of `app.db`), skips without it |
| `case_egress_proxy` | **no** server, daemon, internet or key: it starts the artifact as `proxy egress` on a loopback port and asks it four questions over a socket |
| `case_schema_newer` | no daemon; boots the artifact over a schema-99 database |
| `case_key_proxy_request` | a stand-in `openssl` on `PATH`; asserts the bytes the key proxy really sends |
| `case_server_deploy`, `case_server_service` | two halves each: an **offline** one (`python3` for a `_ping` socket / a `/api/health` responder) and an **online** one (the daemon and an image) that drives a `--root` deploy with `deploy_machine_shims`' `tailscale` on `PATH`; they remove `hs_egress`/`hs_key` before and after, and `case_server_images` must have run first |
| `case_preview` | **its own boot** (stub backend, own data root, `preview_listen = "127.0.0.1:0"`) and, for its second half, the daemon and `agent_image` — it makes its own `s_<id>` container on an `--internal` `agents_<id>` and prints one `SKIP` line without them; the first half always runs and puts the shared boot back |

A story is not done until the gates are green on a clean tree, and then you run the story's own demo
yourself and paste its output.

**Every story adds at least one `case_*`** — the rule is in bold in `docs/build.md` and the reviewer enforces
it. Two shapes to avoid: a case that *needs* a session created two cases earlier, and a case whose `SKIP`
would also fire when the feature it checks is deleted (§6).

**Run one build at a time.** A `scripts/build.sh` or `scripts/verify.sh` in the same tree while another
one runs can make `check-static.sh`'s banner wait flake under load (it happened once during HS-013: the
gate reported `FAIL build/failed` while the same command passed a minute later, alone). Serialise them.

**Rebuild after committing.** `git describe` is baked into the artifact and `check-static.sh` fails on a
stale `dist/`, so a commit without a rebuild leaves the gate red. Commit, then `scripts/verify.sh`, then
the demo you paste.

**Rebuild after editing `web/`, before any demo.** The artifact embeds `web/dist`, so a demo run against
an artifact built before the page changed is a demo of the *old* page — and it will look like your fix
did nothing. HS-020 lost a demo cycle exactly this way: the fix to `main.ts` was invisible until
`scripts/build.sh` ran again. `scripts/verify.sh` rebuilds, so "gate green, then demo" is the safe order.

                            the ladder got there first), or unexpected_exit with the reason. Under a

                            resume (the abort); `end_turn` returns `Ending::{Asked,Forced}` and does

  src/sweeper.rs            the idle stop's task (HS-021): `Sweeper::sweep` (one pass, public for tests),

### What exists and what does not

- **Working:** `version` (text + `--json`), `config {validate,show,edit}`, `serve` (control listener,
  embedded app, `/api/health`, `POST`/`GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/{prompt,abort,steer,resume}`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}[?force=true]`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events`, `…/events/history`, `…/tool-output/{tool_id}`,
  `…/tool-image/{tool_id}/{index}`, `…/changes`, `…/changes/diff[?path=]`), SQLite with **four**
  migrations, the guards, the event writer (which coalesces a commit's deltas), the SSE stream, the stub
  backend and its four-step provisioner, the
  enforced state machine, the abort ladder, the delete flow, the cap with eviction, the create's and the
  resume's three project refusals, the compaction task (which folds a day-old message into one
  `message.snapshot`), the Sessions screen with its create form (which prints a project
  refusal's sentence alone) and the "nothing was deleted" notice, the session screen at
  `/sessions/<id>` with a live transcript and a four-action composer.
- **The agent is real (HS-031) and so is a turn (HS-032 – HS-034).** A Docker create provisions the worktree,
  the network, the attached container running pi in RPC mode, and pi's ready handshake, and ends **`idle`**;
  the agent's directory and the launch line are under the data root, the exit the attached stdio observes is
  classified, and a resume replaces the container and reaches `idle` again. A **prompt** reaches pi, its
  records become the transcript's frames, a tool call's output is filed, and the session's spend is counted —
  with one gap a real container still shows: pi refuses a `prompt` before a stream exists, because a session's
  network is `--internal`, its pi-home has only a dummy key, and the gate's machine stores no provider key, so
  `case_docker_turn` asserts pi's own refusal sentence and the streaming evidence is the committed fixtures —
  while HS-040's recorded run is the evidence that a real turn works end to end through the key proxy (text and
  thinking deltas, a tool round trip, usage), because the gate may not hold a provider key.
- **The egress proxy exists and is the only route out (HS-037).** `holosmith proxy egress` is a mode of the
  artifact; a Docker boot starts `hs_egress` on `egress` (bounded, `warn` on failure) and the network step
  joins it to a session's network under the alias `egress-proxy` **only when the row's `network` flag is set**,
  so `HTTPS_PROXY` is the same string either way and the difference is topology. HS-038 measured that (the boot's
  bare/joined pair and `case_internet_toggle`) and left the **copy** under the checkbox to whoever next owns the
  create form, because a new element is a UI change in a phase that forbids one (ADR-0046).
- **The migration rule has two halves and both are enforced (HS-075).** `schema::contract_violations` refuses an
  unmarked destructive statement in a migration (`cargo test`), and `tests/schema_previous.rs` refuses a drop or a
  rename against `docs/schema/previous.sql` — the gate calls the second the `migrations` **phase**. Refreshing
  that snapshot is a **release step** (`scripts/schema-snapshot.sh`), not a story's, and a contract migration
  changes it in the same commit. `schema::verdict` is the sentence `serve` warns with on a newer database and
  `doctor` refuses with (ADR-0047) — kept by HS-045 without migrating the file.
- **The startup reconcile landed (HS-044).** `serve` awaits `Reconciler::run` right after the state exists and
  before the sweeper and the compactor are spawned: every live row goes to `starting` (with `interrupted` when a
  turn was in flight), the names no row owns are swept (a container unless its row is a `deleting` delete in
  progress; a network and a worktree directory only when no row has the id; never a branch or a ref), and the
  sessions are provisioned again. **What is left of the network half:** nothing but the phase-1 verification
  run (HS-046), which is this handoff's §1 — `doctor` was HS-045. The delete's keep-rules (HS-043) are done and ADR-0052: `agent/<id>` survives a
  delete when it is ahead of its base and in no target, `refs/holosmith/wip/<id>` survives when its tree
  differs from the branch, the 202 carries `kept` (one additive key on the flattened row) and is the same
  decision the spawned removal applies, and the session screen has the **delete affordance it did not have**
  — a Delete button, a confirm step and the forced retry a `409 unsaved_work` earns. **V9 passes** (HS-044);
  nothing in the spec's table is unrun now except V1, V2, V6, V8 and V10's *Result cells* (HS-046 fills them;
  HS-045 built V2's check) and V11 (phase 3). `doctor --full` (HS-045) is what makes V2 — and V10's build, and
  the self-test — repeatable rather than a ceremony. The preview listener (HS-041) is
  done: the binary's third byte tunnel, `/‹host›/‹id›/*` with the prefix stripped and an upgrade's `Origin`
  checked, and **V7 passes** (the host reaches a container on an
  `--internal` network, measured directly and through the artifact). The key proxy (HS-039) and its
  **verification** (HS-040 — V3, V4 and V5 pass) and the WIP snapshot (HS-042) are done, and the spec's
  verification table has a **Result** column that HS-046 finishes filling.
- **Phase 1 is closed by the verification run (HS-046).** `HolosmithSpec.md`'s **Vertical slice verification**
  table is the record: every `V1`–`V10` row carries a verdict and the automation that produced it (a `case_*`, a
  `tests/*.rs`, a `scripts/*.sh`, or `docs/build.md`'s by-hand section), and `V11` still says `deferred to phase 3
  (HS-070)`. V3, V4 and V5 were **not** re-measured by that story — no provider key exists here and no gate may
  hold one — so they quote HS-040's by-hand run and say so. `case_verification_table` is what keeps the table
  honest (ADR-0055), and the gate now prints one `ok <case>` line per case that measured something, withholding
  it for a case that printed `SKIP`.
- **`doctor` exists (HS-045).** `holosmith doctor [--quick|--full]` prints one line per check —
  `check: pass|fail|unknown: sentence` — after a `doctor: <depth>` header and a tally, and exits 1 iff a finding
  failed. `--quick` is the list `serve` refuses on (same `Finding`/`Complaint`, so the sentence is byte-identical)
  plus systemd, the merge trial, Tailscale, the two listeners and the database's schema; `--full` adds the
  network self-test (whose bare probe *is* the network-off probe), `hs_egress`/`hs_key` and the image's pi. On
  this machine `systemd` and `tailscale` are `unknown` (no systemd; no `tailscaled` answering), which is the
  designed outcome, not a failure. Ports are two moments: free before a start, held by this machine's own
  `/api/health` after one. It starts nothing that outlives it. `ExecStartPre=holosmith doctor --quick` is
  **HS-049's** line to write.
- **The log is now read in two shapes and written by two producers of two kinds.** The stream replays a
  *window* (`history_window`, default 50) and says so with `history.truncated`; `GET …/events/history`
  answers the frames below that cursor. `events/stream.rs`'s `REPLAY_LIMIT` is still `u32::MAX` — it is
  "everything from the cut", and a second window there would be an invisible truncation. The project
  backup is a second *writer* of files under the data root (`<data>/backups/`), not of the database.
- **A stop is now recorded as the server's own, and a clean exit has its own state row — observed.**
  `Stopper` writes `expected_stop` before the `docker stop`, and `Exits::record` turns an exit into `stopped`
  (expected), `stopped · pi_exit` (code 0, no flag) or `error` + the last stderr lines. Since HS-031 its
  caller is the task the provisioner spawns after a successful pi step, fed by the backend's `ExitWatcher`
  (ADR-0039). Do not "fix" anything by adding a `docker events` watcher: the attached process *is* the
  observation.
- **Five policies can now stop something and they must not be confused:** the cap evicts (`evicted`,
  inside a create), the sweeper stops a quiet one (`idle_stop`, on its own tick), the turn timeout ends a
  *turn* (`turn_timeout`, from the runner), the token budget ends a *turn* (`budget_exceeded`, also from
  the runner, on one `fired` shared with the timeout so only one climb happens) and the drain stops every
  `idle` row an operator asked for (`server_restart`, over the admin socket). All of them go through
  `Transitioner::apply`, and the row moves before the container in every one of them.
- **`runtime::Backend`** has `Stub` and `Docker`; `serve --backend` and the config key `backend` select
  it. `DockerBackend::new(ContainerSettings)` provisions all four steps, runs a turn's five operations and
  implements the WIP snapshot. The default backend is **`docker`** (ADR-0001: the stub is opt-in), so a
  default build provisions a session to `error` with a reason rather than hanging in `starting`, and
  `scripts/verify.sh` boots with `backend = "stub"` in its config (so does `scripts/check-static.sh`'s
  empty-root run, because a Docker run refuses at startup on a machine that fails the preflight, HS-024, and
  that sandbox has no daemon, no `git` and no `df`). (Since HS-026 a create for a project that is not a plain
  checkout is refused earlier, with a 422; the demo trick HS-019 used still works for a project that *is*
  one — which is also how HS-019 provoked a real failed snapshot from the shipped artifact.)
- **`AppState`** is `{ config, runtime, database: Arc<std::sync::Mutex<Database>>, events: EventWriter,
  streams: StreamRegistry, backend: Backends }`, with **eight** wiring helpers — `provisioner()`,
  `turner()`, `transitioner()`, `ladder()`, `deleter()`, `sweeper()` (an `Option`, `None` when
  `idle_stop_min` is 0), `compactor()` (always `Some`) and `reconciler()` (HS-044). The mutex is an explicit
  stopgap (ADR-0012/0013; `docs/notes.md`'s *Data and state* landmines).
- **`sessions::state::Transitioner::apply`** is the only way a session's state changes; `apply_logged`
  is the runners' wrapper (log, never return). A provisioning step report is `from == to` with `step`
  set and is *not* a table row.
- **The create is one lock scope plus a loop.** `create_locked` answers `Slot::{Inserted, Existing,
  Full}`; a `Full` makes `slot_for` evict one idle session (through `apply`, which takes the lock
  itself) and try again. Idempotency is checked first, so a retry never evicts anyone. `evict_one`
  moves the row **before** it spawns the backend's `stop`, because the row is what frees the slot.
- **`config`** has (`32` keys now) `agent_image` (default `agent-image:<binary version>`; this machine's
  demos and the gate set `pi-agent:local`), `container_cpus` (2), `container_memory_mb` (4096),
  `container_pids` (512) — all three **refuse `0`** — plus `abort_grace` (default `10s`, **used** by the ladder), `idle_stop_min`,
  `stopped_ttl_days`, `min_free_gb`, `turn_timeout_min`, `max_session_tokens` and the rest — check
  `config show` before adding a key. The delete flow and **compaction** have **no** config key of their
  own (the 24-hour window is a constant), and `max_live_sessions` (default 3, ≥ 1) is the cap.
- **`POST /resume`** takes the transition, then spawns the provisioner, and **touches `last_active_at`**
  (a resumed session must not be the eviction's first candidate — which is now a real policy, not a
  future one). The cap is checked **before** the transition, and the resume answers `409 cap_reached`
  rather than evicting (ADR-0022, ADR-0024). `SessionBackend::resume` has had a body since HS-029 and is how
  a `stopped` row comes back.

---

## 5. The cycle — one issue, then write the state back

Everything is **sequential: one writer at a time**, never two children editing files. Review children are
read-only and may run in parallel.

1. **Confirm the issue.** Read §1's slice, the Linear body (`python3 /tmp/lin.py issue <IDENT>`, §2) and the
   spec items. **Check the issue's title against the story you mean** — the Linear number is not derivable
   from the `HS-` number (HS-059 is `PER-91`, not `PER-93`; a session wrote `Closes PER-93` for it and had to
   record the correction in three places). Note `HEAD` — that SHA is the review's fixed point.
2. **Plan.** For an **L** story, give a fresh `delegate` child a grilling brief
   (`~/.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` + `domain-modeling`): it puts **one** round of questions to *you*
   via `contact_supervisor`, and you answer with `subagent_supervisor({action:"reply", …})`. For **S/M**
   (HS-043 is M), write the plan yourself — it is faster and the analysis is usually already done. Either
   way: state the environment facts, name the files to read, list the decisions already settled, and
   **pre-answer the obvious round-2 questions**. A planner may write only `GLOSSARY.md` and a new
   `docs/adr/*.md`.
3. **Record in Linear before any code exists**: `save_comment` with the plan shape, a decisions→precedent
   table, the acceptance restated as testable checks, the non-goals, the docs touched, the demo, and the
   follow-ups; then `state` the issue `In Progress` and re-read it to confirm.
4. **Implement.** Two proven patterns: **S/M in-session** (most stories since HS-016), or **M/L with a lot
   of new surface** handed to a fresh `worker` child with a *written* brief — the plan plus the "how", the
   ground rules (no commit, no Linear, no new dependency, `env.sh` first, don't edit `docs/stories/**`), the
   exact gate commands, and "budget discipline: keep the tree compiling; if you run long, stop green and
   report which steps remain". Twice a child found a genuine contradiction in the brief — verify its claims
   rather than trusting them.
5. **Verify yourself.** Never trust a child's pasted output: run the gates and the demo. This has caught
   something every time (a wrong count, a demo-revealed message bug, a panic path, an assertion that passed
   over an already-stopped row).
6. **Review** with a fresh `reviewer` child running `~/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, read-only,
   against `<fixed point>...HEAD` plus untracked files, spec axis sourced from the Linear body + story slice
   + spec items. `git add -A` first and write `git diff --cached <fp>` to
   `/tmp/holosmith/reviews/PER-<n>-diff.txt` so new files appear. **The reviewer has no shell and no write
   tool**: check its claims, and *you* save the review verbatim to `docs/review/PER-<n>.md`. **Commit before
   launching it** — a child reading a tree that moves under it stalls.
7. **Fix** in the same session (or with a fresh `worker`), triaging every finding as fixed or
   dismissed-with-citation; a "won't fix" without a citation is not acceptable. Re-run the gates. Append a
   `## Resolution` table to the review file and commit it with the fixes. If a claim cannot be dismissed,
   mutate the code and watch the guarding test go red before believing it.
8. **Ship**: focused conventional commits that name the issue, the last one ending `Closes <IDENT>` (§1's
   identifier). Commit messages are prose about *why*, not a restatement of the diff — look at the last few
   for tone. Rebuild after committing (§3). Then `save_comment` with what shipped, the gates, the verbatim
   demo output, the acceptance item by item and the follow-ups; set the issue `Done`; re-read it to confirm.
9. **Push**, with the sandbox's single-key loop (§2). If the push fails, report it — never fake one.
10. **Write the state back.** Rewrite §1 of this file for the next issue (§1.10's shape), refresh
    the counts, the ADR number, the last gate run's numbers and §9's row, then commit that with the message
    `Refresh the handoff after <IDENT>`. Set §1's replacement by `PROMPT.md`'s ranking (Linear priority →
    `HS-###` order → anything already `In Progress` → skip an issue whose `Blocked by` stories are not `Done`).
11. **Kill every child you started, then stop.** This is the last thing a session does, and it is not
    optional: a child still running holds the working tree, a port, a data root or a Docker network, and the
    next agent then finds a tree that moves under it, a port that is taken, or a `case_*` that fails for a
    reason that belongs to *your* session. Nothing may outlive the session that started it.
    - **Subagent children:** `subagent({action:"list"})` and `subagent({action:"stop", id})` on every run
      that is still live — the planner, every `worker`, every `reviewer`, and one you left `interrupted`. A
      run that already answered needs nothing; a run that is *listed as running* is the one that matters.
      `stop` is not resumable, which is exactly right at the end of a session: a half-finished brief is
      recoverable from Linear and `docs/review/`, a child that keeps editing the tree is not.
    - **Processes:** every demo's `serve`, every backgrounded `timeout` wrapper, `scripts/verify.sh` if you
      interrupted it, and any `node`/`python3` client you left running. **Score the pids when you start them
      and kill those pids** — `pgrep -f 'holosmith serve'` matches unrelated processes (a landmine, in
      `docs/notes.md`), so a pattern-based kill is both too broad and unreliable.
    - **Docker:** `docker rm -f` every container a demo or a test made (`s_*`, `hs_*` names of yours) and
      `docker network rm` the `agents_*` network it made; leave the machine's own `hs_egress`/`hs_key`
      alone if `serve` is not yours to stop, and never remove a container you did not create.
    - **Check it, do not assume it:** `subagent({action:"list"})` shows nothing running, the pids you scored
      are gone, `docker ps` shows none of your containers, and `git status --short` is clean apart from the
      operator's own `log.txt`/`orchestrate.sh`. Then say in one line what you killed, and stop.

## 6. Which notes bear on this issue

The catalogue lives in **`docs/notes.md`** — read the **cross-cutting** sections before you start anything,
then the sections below. It is a reference: everything there is a measurement or a review finding.

| Read | Why it bears on HS-054's fast-forward merge |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-cutting: *Build and toolchain*, *Tests*, *Config and docs*, *Demos*, *Reviews* | True of every story. This one's sharpest: **HTTP and the envelope** — the first route in this build that *writes* to the project repository, so the guards, `bad_body` (the body is taken as a `Result`), and two new codes with sentences a client can act on; and **Tests** — a merge fixture where the branch and the target are identical cannot tell "fast-forwarded" from "did nothing" (the same trap as HS-052's symmetric counts). |
| *Landmines: worktrees (HS-025)* | The naming rule (`agent/<id>`, `.worktrees/<id>`), `ahead`, and `registrations` (git's own `worktree list --porcelain`) — **the measurement of "is the target checked out anywhere"**. Also the rule that a worktree operation is the *host's*: the sentence "all git work runs on the host in the project repository; no container is involved" is this story's too. |
| *Landmines: the changes view (HS-052)* + *Landmines: the unified diff (HS-053)* | The two neighbours, and the refusals this story inherits (`basis`'s ordered four, the 409 sentences). HS-052 records why the basis is two-dot and why a symmetric fixture measures nothing; HS-053 records the config-can-run-a-program lesson (`diff.external`, textconv) and the gate-shell SIGPIPE that has now cost two stories. |
| *Landmines: project refusals and coalescing (HS-026, HS-059)* | `refuse`/`CONFIG_READ`: how this build asks git a question whose answer a repository's own config could subvert. A merge runs `git merge --ff-only` **in the operator's checkout**, where `core.hooksPath` decides whether a `post-merge` hook runs agent-written code — the same fear, one level up. |
| *Landmines: what a delete keeps (HS-043)* | `retained`/`merges_into` and the sentence "the branch is deleted because it is merged" (rule 5). This story's merge is what makes that true, and HS-056 is what acts on it — so a merge that leaves `agent/<id>` ahead of the target would silently break the delete's own reasoning. |
| *Landmines: the doctor, the ports and a read-only open (HS-045)* | `doctor`'s V2 merge trial is `merge-tree --write-tree` — the same question this story answers by *acting on*. The three-armed fact (`pass`/`fail`/`unknown`, and `Merge::Unasked`) is the shape a fallible git question takes here; a merge that cannot run is a `500` with git's words, never a `200` with nothing moved. |
| *Landmines: tool output, usage and the gate's shell (HS-033, HS-034)* | The gate's shell rules (no `awk`, no `shellcheck`), and the "large body in a shell variable" bullet, which HS-053 hit twice: `printf "$big" \| grep -q` reports 141 *when the needle matched*. A case that compares a repository state after a merge does not need big bodies, but the rule stands. |
| *Landmines: the drain and its socket (HS-051)* | The precedent for a module whose every line is a *refusal* or a *measurement*, and the boot discipline a case that owns a repository must keep (`--admin-dir` and `projects_root` passed, never inherited). |

Three rules worth repeating here because they are the most expensive to relearn: **a test that cannot fail
is worse than no test** (mutate the behaviour and watch it go red); **a gate case that SKIPs on the bug it
exists to catch is this project's P1**; and **after any scripted Markdown edit, read the changed lines** —
three such edits have cost a review finding each.

## 7. Decisions taken on the operator's behalf (do not silently undo)

Almost every hard-to-reverse decision is an ADR (`docs/adr/0001` … `0062`, one line each in
`docs/stories/README.md`): read the recent ones before planning, and **amend rather than rewrite** — an ADR
a later story changes gets a "Superseded by ADR-00xx" note (0012/0013, and 0026 amended 0020).

The handful that are **not** in an ADR, and that a fresh session is most likely to undo by accident:

- the default branch stays **`master`** — this repo has no `main`, and renaming it would be an invented
  change;
- **never fake a push**: report the failure instead (§2's loop is how a push actually works);
- **`docs/stories/**` is not edited** — it is the source the Linear issues were imported from; a contract
  that needs changing goes in an ADR;
- the default backend is **`docker`** with the stub opt-in (ADR-0001), so every test and script that boots
  `serve` says which backend it means;
- **S/M stories are implemented in-session; M/L ones go to a worker child with a written brief** (§5);
- the **Linear issue number is not derivable from the story number** — read the title before writing
  `Closes <IDENT>`;
- **one issue per session, then write the state back and stop** (this file's own rule, §5 steps 10–11);
- **nothing a session starts outlives it** — every subagent run, every demo server and every container it
  made is stopped before it stops (§5, step 11). A leftover child is not harmless: it keeps editing a tree
  the next agent has to trust.

## 8. Resume checklist

```bash
cd /home/adamolsson/projects/holosmith
git status --short                                  # clean apart from log.txt/orchestrate.sh
. ~/.pi/toolchains/env.sh                           # ALWAYS before cargo/rustc
python3 /tmp/lin.py issues | grep -v ' Done ' | head # recreate /tmp/lin.py first (§2)
python3 /tmp/lin.py issue PER-86                    # scoped, Backlog, the issue §1 names
docker version                                      # the daemon must answer, or a Docker check cannot be measured
docker image inspect pi-agent:local                 # the image the Docker stories run
docker network ls | grep -w egress                  # the proxy test's premise (§2); `grep -x` never matches
docker rm -f hs_egress hs_key 2>/dev/null           # so tests/container.rs runs its real path
scripts/verify.sh                                   # baseline green, ~9–12 min (it prints its own counts)
```

If the baseline is red before you touch anything, that is the first thing you fix — and say so in Linear.

Then start §5 on **§1's issue** (`PER-86`, HS-054) and stop after step 11.

Before you begin, check that the last session left nothing behind — `subagent({action:"list"})` should show
no run in progress, `docker ps` none of its containers, and `git status --short` should look like the line
above. If it does not, that is the first thing you fix, and say so in Linear: a tree another session is still
editing is a stop-the-line error, not an inconvenience.

## 9. Reporting

The durable record is **Linear** (plan, demo output and ship note per issue), **`docs/review/PER-<n>.md`**
(the review verbatim and its `## Resolution` table) and **`git log`**. Keep a short ledger in the
conversation while the session runs (issue → plan → implement → review → fix → ship) so a restart can see it
from those three; do not carry old sessions' ledgers in this file.

If you stop before the issue ships, say so explicitly, name the next action, and leave the tree clean and the
gates green — **a half-finished story is worse than an honest stop**.

**The last shipped story** (`PER-85`, HS-053, ADR-0062; commits `01058bd`, `e0f569e`, `8fb3659`, `0eae606`): the
changes view's unified diff, `GET /api/sessions/{id}/changes/diff?path=` — the second bullet of item 12, and the
first thing in this build whose answer is *bytes a person reads* rather than JSON. It is `changes::diff` beside the
summary, sharing an extracted `basis()` so the four `409 no_worktree` refusals and the branch's tip are one rule for
both routes; the answer is a `text/plain` body, `charset=utf-8` only when the bytes really are UTF-8 (git prints a
file's own bytes). Three decisions had a plausible wrong answer: the cap is on the **whole body** so the marker's
length is budgeted out of the diff (and the marker names the **total**, never "showed N", because that would make
its own length depend on the cut it finances); a `path` is a **member of `files[]`**, compared and never joined, so
`sub/../a.txt` is refused like an unchanged file and traversal is impossible by construction; and the read is
**bounded** — 256 KB kept, 8 MiB counted, then killed — so a monster diff costs milliseconds. `--no-ext-diff
--no-textconv --no-color` are pinned *and* measured, because a test can write a repository's local config
(`diff.external`, a textconv driver, `color.ui = always`) — which corrected the previous story's comment claiming
that was impossible. The review found no P1 and nine smaller things: two documents describing code the same change
had replaced, "longer than N" at exactly the ceiling (now "at least"), the ADR's memory sentence ignoring the stderr
drain, a dead public method (now used), a `seq` guard that could skip the case over a fixture, a member reaching git
as a *pathspec* (now `--literal-pathspecs`, with a test that goes red without it), a UTF-8-floor test that would
have passed with the floor deleted (it now asserts its own premise), and an unmeasured ADR claim (now a test). The
gate grew `case_changes_diff` and its two header helpers got a real fix: `printf "$big" | grep -q` under `pipefail`
reports 141 *when it matches*, so a passing assertion printed a `FAIL`. The gate: **79 cases, 1174 assertions**, no
`SKIP`; `cargo test` 981/51, `web` 52. Its full record is Linear, `docs/review/PER-85.md` and `git log`; do not
carry it forward.

**One thing this build does not do, recorded rather than discovered:** a resumed session's pi has **no
memory** of earlier turns (`--no-session`; the transcript is Holosmith's log). Replaying the log into a new pi
is a product decision with a token cost and needs its own story — ADR-0040 and ADR-0039 both say so, and
nothing in the backlog owns it yet.
